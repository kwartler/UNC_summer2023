Today, there are large youth populations reaching adolescence in many developing countries. These countries therefore have a unique opportunity seize a demographic dividend – but first they must invest in good health, quality education and decent employment opportunities for their young people.   The event is being jointly convened by the President of the General Assembly and the President of the Economic and Social Council, with support from UNFPA, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the International Labour Organization, the International Telecommunication Union and others. Speakers will include President of the General Assembly Peter Thomson, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, UNFPA Acting Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem and UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth Jayathma Wickramanayake.
