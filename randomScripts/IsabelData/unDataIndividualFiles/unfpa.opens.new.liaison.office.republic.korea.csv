The new office, opened during an official ceremony today, will facilitate even closer cooperation on global population and development matters, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, population ageing and humanitarian response.   Collaboration between UNFPA and the Republic of Korea goes back to 1974 when UNFPA helped the government in the area of population policy and planning, including rights-based family planning, population surveys and using data for sustainable development.  “This is a very auspicious moment for UNFPA, as we mark our 50th year as the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, promoting rights and choices for all. UNFPA has long been proud of its special relationship with the Republic of Korea, and our new liaison office will strengthen this important partnership,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem.  “As a developing country in the 1970s, the Republic of Korea made crucial investments in health, family planning, education and women’s empowerment, spurring a significant demographic dividend,"" added Dr. Kanem. ""Now, it is sharing its wealth of experience, resources and best practices to support developing countries in Asia-Pacific and globally. UNFPA looks forward to enhancing our engagement with the Republic of Korea on sexual and reproductive health, population ageing and other issues, and to contributing together to a world of health, rights and choices for all ages across the life cycle.”  The UNFPA liaison office is based at the Yonsei University campus in Seoul, which allows for an exchange of expertise between UNFPA and this noted academic institution in the fields of health care, women’s rights and development. The office will also liaise with various government ministries and institutions, as well as South Korean civil society organizations, the private sector, media and other stakeholders.  This year marks UNFPA’s 50th anniversary, as well as the 25th anniversary of the Programme of Action stemming from the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), the revolutionary agreement that placed human rights and individual choice at the heart of sustainable development.  The Republic of Korea was one of the 179 countries that adopted the ICPD Programme of Action, seeing it as key to socio-economic advancement. The country continues to strongly support the vision enshrined within the Programme of Action, whose success is essential to fulfilling the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.    For more information, please contact:Sae-Ryo Kim, email: sakim@unfpa.org; mobile: +82-10-9291-5338UNFPA is the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, ensuring rights and choices for all    "
