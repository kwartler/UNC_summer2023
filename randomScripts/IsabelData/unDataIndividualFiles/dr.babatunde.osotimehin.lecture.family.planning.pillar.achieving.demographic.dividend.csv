Dr. Osotimehin dedicated his life to the conviction that sexual and reproductive health and rights, and in particular high-quality, accessible family planning for all, must be prioritized in the global development agenda. The lecture, to be delivered by Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed, will address the theme of Family Planning as a Pillar in Achieving the Demographic Dividend. As one of the key issues Dr. Osotimehin championed, the lecture will underscore how shared progress towards the FP2020 goal of enabling an additional 120 million women and girls to use voluntary modern contraception by 2020 is integral to achieving the demographic dividend, particularly on the African continent. The lecture will be held from 5 to 6 pm, London time, and all are welcome to join in viewing the event. It will be live-streamed on the UNFPA YouTube page.   "
