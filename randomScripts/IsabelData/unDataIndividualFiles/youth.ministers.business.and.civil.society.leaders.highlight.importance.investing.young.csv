In countries with large youth populations, young people who are educated, empowered and employed can boost development. Growing up healthy and educated, and free from dangers such as child marriage, young people tend to have fewer children and are able to earn, save and invest more money in themselves and the economy. This boost in growth is known as a demographic dividend, and can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by the year 2030. However, such a dividend is only possible where health, education, decent work and the right policies are in place. The event is being convened by the Presidents of the United Nations General Assembly and of the Economic and Social Council, with support from UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, and other partners.
