"https://www.unfpa.org/events/high-level-event-demographic-dividend-and-youth-employment","This high-level event brings together policymakers, business leaders, and representatives of civil society and youth groups to explore strategies and best practices to help countries realize a demographic dividend – the economic benefits that can arise when a population has a relatively large proportion of working-age people. To realize this dividend, there is an urgent need to empower, educate and employ the world’s young people. There are 1.8 billion young people in the world. Supporting their development and helping to fulfil their potential will be essential to all the world's future.       This one-day event is being convened by the President of the United Nations General Assembly, with the support of the United Nations Population Fund and the International Labour Organization. It will be livestreamed at webtv.un.org/live.  #demographicdividend Tweets    ////"
