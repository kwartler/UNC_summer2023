This is the message we will be bringing to the third International Conference on Family Planning (ICFP 2013) in Addis Ababa next week. As political leaders, researchers, young people and advocates in the field of family planning and reproductive health come together in Ethiopia from 10-15 November to call attention to the wide-ranging benefits of helping people plan their families, UNFPA will underscore the importance of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, especially for young people and other vulnerable groups. More than 40 per cent of the world’s population is under age 25 and reproductive choices are the key to ensuring that this young generation will have a future. When a girl becomes pregnant, her present and future radically change—rarely for the better. All too often, a girl’s education will end, and her job prospects evaporate, while her vulnerabilities to poverty, health problems, social exclusion and dependency multiply. Political commitment and support are necessary to ensure that the benefits of family planning can be extended to all those who need them. UNFPA will organize and support a number of events with partners to address these issues, including: Nov 10 – 11African Union Youth Pre-Conference MeetingInvesting in our future: Addressing Family Planning within the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights of Youthful Africa Location: African Union Commission Headquarters Please visit http://youthfpc.org/ for more information The African Union pre-conference will give participants the opportunity to interact with high level decision makers, family planning experts, and other stakeholders to highlight reproductive health challenges faced by young people and allow participants to work out innovative solutions to ensure that family planning and other youth sexual and reproductive health and rights needs are properly situated in the post-2015 development agenda. UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin will deliver the keynote address and encourage young people and policy makers that investing in the sexual and reproductive health of youth in Africa is an investment in our common future.

Nov 12, 7:30am – 3:30 pm:High-Level Ministerial MeetingThe Youth Dividend—Return on Investment in Family Planning Location: African Union Conference Center For more information please access http://www.fpconference2013.org/program/policy/ More than 20 Ministers of Finance and Planning, Health, Youth, and Gender are among the leaders who will convene on 12 November to discuss the investments needed—especially in family planning—to meet the needs of Africa’s youth today, and to maximize their future potential for national development. The High-Level Ministerial Meeting will be held in conjunction with the third International Conference on Family Planning (ICFP 2013) in Addis Ababa. Discussions will focus on the key role of family planning in helping nations reap the benefits of a 'demographic dividend'—the accelerated economic growth that can result from a rapid decline in a country’s fertility rate coupled with smart investments in health, education and job creation. Multiple Asian countries have achieved the demographic dividend. Now, with the right investments, it could be within the reach of African nations.

Adolescent Pregnancy, Rights and Realities Location: AU Conference Center -- 2nd level, Small Conference Hall 1 For millions of girls, pregnancy has little to do with choice.
