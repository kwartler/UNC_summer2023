NA,"events","13 September 2016","Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations, the General Assembly occupies a central position as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations. Comprising all 193 Members of the United Nations, it provides a unique forum for multilateral discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter. This year, the General Assembly will mark the anniversary of the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs). UNFPA is working with governments, partners and other UN agencies to achieve many of these goals, particularly those focused on health, gender equality and education. UNFPA is also focusing on the human rights and reproductive health needs of the most vulnerable people, especially those living in humanitarian crises. Among its many activities around this year's General Assembly, UNFPA will be highlighting the special needs of refugee women and girls at the UN Summit on Refugees and Migrants. UNFPA will be holding the New York launch of its Compact for Young People in Humanitarian Action, and hosting a high-level dialogue on accelerating Africa's demographic dividend. UNFPA will also organize a special event to promote the needs of pregnant women and new mothers in emergencies through its Safe Birth Even Here initiative. And UNFPA will be working with partners to improve the sexual and reproductive health and rights of marginalized and vulnerable populations, including adolescent girls.
