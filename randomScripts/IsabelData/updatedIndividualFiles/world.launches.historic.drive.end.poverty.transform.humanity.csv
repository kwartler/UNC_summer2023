UNITED NATIONS, New York, 31 December 2015-- The world will make history tomorrow by officially launching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  the new development agenda that promises to lift millions of people from poverty, save and improve the lives of billions, and protect our planet. We at UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, reiterate our full commitment to the achievement of these goals by 2030. The 17 SDGs reflect world leaders firm commitment to ensuring individual rights and well-being, and supporting universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including family planning. The goals recognize the critical need to empower women and young people so they can realize their rights and potential. They also underline that providing young people, including adolescent girls, with a nurturing environment for the full realization of their rights and capabilities, will help countries reap a demographic dividend of increased economic growth. The new development agenda presents us with a unique opportunity to achieve a world of equality and inclusion, health, education and sustainability. Key to success is to collect and use population data, strengthen efforts to mitigate and respond to humanitarian crises and address the root causes of poverty and conflict. All the SDG goals are central to UNFPAs mandate, and we pledge to work with all partners to turn them into reality. As we support countries to implement and achieve the 2030 Agenda, we will strive to ensure that no one is left behind ***"
