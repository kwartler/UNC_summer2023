NA,"press","17 September 2015","Media Advisory  Investing in Young People to Secure Peace, Security in Lake Chad Basin Nations Attacked by Terrorists 17 September 2015   UNITED NATIONS, New YorkIn support of ongoing initiatives for countries affected by the current terrorist crisis in the Lake Chad Basin area (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria), UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, is organizing a special event during the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit. The event will make an important contribution to dealing with the crisis, building resilient communities in the sub-region and preserving their gains from the Millennium Development Goals, while helping affected countries pursue the upcoming Sustainable Development Goals. In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, insurgents are exploiting the huge youth populations which, otherwise, could be assets for employment, innovation and development. It is a potential which, if combined with the right policies and demographic transitions, could provide the region with the opportunity to harness a demographic dividend that leads to rapid economic development. The demographic dividend is the accelerated economic growth that could result when a countrys working age population grows larger than the non-working dependents. While the crisis damages entire communities, women are particularly targeted. As of April 2015, more than 2,000 women and young girls have been abducted, according to Amnesty International. The UNFPA event, expected to be addressed by Heads of State of affected countries and leaders of international organizations, will offer an opportunity to propose strategic initiatives to support and empower young people and protect them from manipulation and radicalization.
