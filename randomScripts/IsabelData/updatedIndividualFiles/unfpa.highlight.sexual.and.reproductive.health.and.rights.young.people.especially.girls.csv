This is the message we will be bringing to the third International Conference on Family Planning (ICFP 2013) in Addis Ababa next week. As political leaders, researchers, young people and advocates in the field of family planning and reproductive health come together in Ethiopia from 10-15 November to call attention to the wide-ranging benefits of helping people plan their families, UNFPA will underscore the importance of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, especially for young people and other vulnerable groups. More than 40 per cent of the worlds population is under age 25 and reproductive choices are the key to ensuring that this young generation will have a future. When a girl becomes pregnant, her present and future radically changerarely for the better. All too often, a girls education will end, and her job prospects evaporate, while her vulnerabilities to poverty, health problems, social exclusion and dependency multiply. Political commitment and support are necessary to ensure that the benefits of family planning can be extended to all those who need them. UNFPA will organize and support a number of events with partners to address these issues, including: Nov 10  11African Union Youth Pre-Conference MeetingInvesting in our future: Addressing Family Planning within the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights of Youthful Africa Location: African Union Commission Headquarters Please visit http://youthfpc.org/ for more information The African Union pre-conference will give participants the opportunity to interact with high level decision makers, family planning experts, and other stakeholders to highlight reproductive health challenges faced by young people and allow participants to work out innovative solutions to ensure that family planning and other youth sexual and reproductive health and rights needs are properly situated in the post-2015 development agenda.
