The new UNFPA-UNESCO strategic partnership aims to tackle educational and health needs concurrently in order to eliminate economic barriers and generate social empowerment for young people. It will:  Advance universal access to basic quality education and literacy programmes; Implement integrated educational approaches and programmes on issues related to population, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence and HIV/AIDS; Address young peoples rights and needs; Build on the role of culture for sustainable development. The partnership was warmly welcomed by Dr. Osotimehin and Ms. Bokova as a critical step in securing the future of young people in developing countries. I believe that the developing world can reach the demographic dividend quickly if it invests in appropriate education to take them to a new level,"" said Dr. Osotimehin.    "
