On behalf of UNFPA, she welcomed the 2022 Annual Report on the evaluation function, and two recent centralized evaluations, the evaluation of UNFPA support to population dynamics and data and the formative evaluation of UNFPA support to adolescents and youth. She commended innovative approaches in evaluation, such as leveraging Artificial Intelligence and enhancing intergenerational partnerships with youth in evaluation.  Marco Segone, Director, UNFPA Evaluation Office presented the 2022 Annual Report on the evaluation function and the key results of the two centralized evaluations. The Annual Report on evaluation presents the performance, innovation and areas of growth for the evaluation function in 2022. The report captures UNFPA efforts to contribute to the United Nations development system reform process, as well as efforts to build national evaluation capacities, in partnership with youth and parliamentarians.  The evaluation of UNFPA support to population dynamics and data is the first evaluation on this theme at UNFPA, and includes a specific focus on the demographic dividend, population ageing and low fertility. The evaluation of UNFPA support to adolescents and youth assesses the implementation of the UNFPA Strategy on Adolescents and Youthand provides actionable recommendations to advance the Strategy roll-out. The evaluation engaged youth in multiple roles such as advisors, contributors, evaluators, and key informants. An innovative Youth Steering Committee co-managed the evaluation, alongside senior evaluators.  Ms.Diene Keita, UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Programme), delivered the management commentary on the Annual Report on evaluation, and the two centralized evaluations. She commended the Evaluation Office for making the evaluation function fit to deliver adaptive, high-quality and relevant evaluations, that help improve development results. She reiterated that the management had accepted all recommendations of the two evaluations. The recommendations were highly relevant and catalytic to further the achievement of the UNFPA Strategic Plan 2022-2025, and will contribute to the forthcoming global review of the 30th anniversary of the ICPD and the Summit of the Future in 2024.        In a joint statement, 22 Member States (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Moldova, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Trkiye) welcomed the Annual Report on evaluation and the two centralized evaluations.
