Together they will develop recommendations to accelerate progress towards the goals set out in Cairo in 1994, which emphasize the needs and sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls. Organized in partnership with the African Union and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the five-day conference, ""Harnessing the Demographic Dividend: The future we want for Africa,"" aims for state and non-state actors to recommit themselves at the highest level to fully implement the ICPD Programme of Action. Speaking on behalf of UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, Deputy Executive Director (Management) Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen highlighted Africas achievements in dramatically reducing maternal, infant and child mortality since 1994. She also drew attention to the regions response to HIV/AIDS which has led to reductions in transmission rates in almost all countries. The regions responsiveness to the collection of data on achievements, gaps and challenges was a sign of their ongoing commitment, she emphasized. The ICPD Beyond 2014 global survey, which was completed by 52 of 54 countries in the [Africa] region, shows an overwhelming commitment to the eradication of poverty; creating employment opportunities for youth; ensuring right and access to sexual and reproductive health services, including HIV prevention for young people; eliminating mother-to child transmission of HIV; increasing womens access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services; and promoting environmental resources management, said Ms. Albrectsen.  The survey has however highlighted the work that still needs to be done to achieve the vision of Cairo. Despite the gains and tremendous progress since 1994, this region faces serious challenges. Africa continues to lag behind other regions and there remain significant inequalities in access to quality services, information and education across and within countries in Africa, she told the opening session of the conference. She further detailed how inequality, social exclusion, gender inequity, poor governance and corruption in some areas, as well as the lack of participation by women, young people and other marginalised groups, continue to hold the development of the region back and limit its great potential for sustainable economic growth. This is all underscored by the limited research and data available. Africas current demographic transition is going to be crucial for Africas future. With an unprecedented youth bulge, how Africa deals with the transition could make or break the continent.""

NA,"press","20 September 2017","    Speech  Demographic Dividend Roadmap for Africa: Moving from Commitment to Action 20 September 2017   Opening Statement by Dr. Natalia Kanem, Acting Executive Director of UNFPA, during the African Union side event ""Demographic Dividend Roadmap for Africa: Moving from Commitment to Action"" on the margins of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly. [As prepared for delivery] Your Excellency, President Alpha Cond, Chair of the African UnionExcellencies, Heads of State and Government gathered here today,Distinguished guests,Ladies and gentlemen, I thank His Excellency, President Alpha Cond, and the African Union for convening this important event here today. It is a decisive moment for the African continent, for its young people, women and girls; and for the prospects for people-driven  and youth-driven  sustainable development for the world at large. Despite erratic economic growth over the years, many African countries through enormous efforts have achieved considerable progress in expanding access to education and health. It is appropriate to pause for a minute and recognize these efforts and this progress. Amidst a rapidly growing cohort of primary school age pupils, countries have managed to increase enrollment and completion rates. And amidst a growing number of people who require medical attention, they have managed to increase access to essential health care services. Yet, gains in education and health do not reach those lagging furthest behind, and opportunities are not able to satisfy the growing population of young people. Unemployment and under-employment remain massive challenges. And every day thousands more young people enter the labour market looking for productive and remunerative employment. The majority of them will not find it. Some countries are facing conflict and related displacements, and many are already starting to experience the impacts of climate change, which is adding to instability and undermining gains already made. According to a recent World Economic Forum report, competitiveness on the continent as a whole is relatively stagnant, propped up by successful social investments early in life, but held back by lack of infrastructure, limited opportunities for labour-driven growth, and challenges in keeping pace with rapid technological change. Some of Africas young people are in turn looking to other countries and continents to fulfil their aspirations. But there is hope on the horizon. Heads of State and Government in Africa have committed to harnessing the Demographic Dividend through Investments in Youth and proclaimed the upcoming decade as the African Decade for Technical, Professional, and Entrepreneurial Training and Youth Employment. I was at the African Union when the theme of the year on demographic dividend was deliberated upon, and was struck by the fervent and robust debate and the clear desire of African leaders to tap into the potential of youth, women and adolescents in order to grow their economies. It is vital that countries invest in human capital development throughout the life course of their people. While hardly anyone would take issue with this recommendation, it is a fact that in many countries this recommendation has not yet been translated into policies and programmes. The lions share of education expenditures are allocated to the first phase of life, whereas the majority of health care expenditures focus on the later phases. To some extent this imbalance is natural and it will never completely change, but the imbalance is simply too large. We need more investment in life-long education, and we need much more investment in a healthy life course. While it is generally recognized that human capital requires good education and good health, I often observe that the subsequent discussions focus on education and neglect the health aspects. This may be because we often are not entirely clear about what good health means, and how good health is to be promoted from early ages onward. Let me just emphasize here that good health throughout the life course begins even before a child is born with the nutrition of the mother, and it includes maternal, newborn and child health. Later on in life young people, especially adolescent girls, experience significant challenges to their health due to inadequate access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and services. If a teenage girl becomes a mother, or if she is married off as a child bride, she is also unlikely to complete her education and fully develop her potential. She will be less than she can be. She will find it hard to find work and make an independent living. She will live a life of diminished opportunities, will be more dependent on others, and she will be vulnerable to abuse and discrimination. In short, we must rethink human capital. It is not enough to focus on the right kind of education, we also must get serious about the promotion of life-long health. Sexual and reproductive health and rights is particularly important for the empowerment of girls and women to fully develop their human capital.  Along with this accelerated development, African leaders understand that addressing the concerns of youth, ensuring that they are well-educated, healthy and empowered, is the most important prevention mechanism and one of the surest ways to improve peace and security on the Continent. Actualizing this vision demands an integrated approach to development policy, linking health and rights, skills development and the labour market, social investments in young people and targeted investments in labour-intensive growth. To be able to harness this synergy, the necessary infrastructure has to be in place to follow up on and coordinate the work at the country level, as committed to by African leaders three months ago in Addis Ababa. Today we are all eager to hear from Heads of State and Government who have guided their countries forward in making the institutional changes and fostering the partnerships necessary to deliver such an integrated approach. We will also hear about the social investment packages on the ground that are helping people navigate critical transitions from childhood to adolescence and adulthood, that are delivering advances right now to help young people deliver for themselves, their families, their communities and indeed society. Together, African leaders are truly moving their populations from Commitment to Action on the Demographic Dividend, the path that the African Unions Roadmap has so effectively charted. I pledge the support of UNFPA in this journey. We look forward to hearing from you, Excellencies and Partners, that are working together to implement the Demographic Dividend Roadmap on how we can ensure that African countries are able to maximize these efforts in order to realize the hopes of their young people and fulfilltheirlegitimate aspirationsfor better lives. Thank you.     "
NA,"events","10 July 2017","In advance of the2017 Family Planning Summit, the global community will pause to acknowledge the legacy ofUNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin. Dr. Osotimehin dedicated his life to the conviction that sexual and reproductive health and rights, and in particular high-quality, accessible family planning for all, must be prioritized in the global development agenda. The lecture, to be delivered by Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed, will address the theme ofFamily Planning as a Pillar in Achieving the Demographic Dividend. As one of the key issues Dr. Osotimehin championed, the lecture will underscore how shared progress towards the FP2020 goal of enabling an additional 120 million women and girls to use voluntary modern contraception by 2020 is integral to achieving the demographic dividend, particularly on the African continent. The lecture will be held from 5 to 6 pm, London time, and all are welcome to join in viewing the event. It will be live-streamed on the UNFPA YouTube page.   "

But to do so, they must be empowered, educated and employed.  UNFPA Cote d'Ivoire  29 May 2015   DAKAR, Senegal  ""I knew I was pregnant, but I talked to my classmate, not my parents or my teachers, said Amina, 18, a student in Daoukro, Cte dIvoire. My parents were very upset and not kind. They rejected me."" The young people of Cte dIvoire are poised to transform their countrys future. The country is in a position to reap a demographic dividend, the economic growth that can result from having a relatively large proportion of working-age people  provided those people are empowered, educated and employed. But stories like Aminas show how easily their efforts can be derailed. A nationwide campaign has been launched to help empower and educate Cte dIvoire's young people, and to prepare them for future employment. Starting in 2013, the Zero Pregnancies in Schools campaign has contributed to a staggering 20 per cent decline in youth pregnancies compared to the previous year. Education is key I have suffered and I felt alone, Amina told UNFPA. Yet she is not alone: For every 1,000 girls aged 15 to 19 in Cte dIvoire, 125 become pregnant and give birth. Globally, this number is 50.  Students now receive comprehensive sexuality education, which provides age-appropriate information about anatomy, sexual and reproductive health and human rights. UNFPA WCARO The repercussions of adolescent pregnancy are far-reaching. Many pregnant girls are forced to drop out of school, limiting their prospects and their contributions. The campaign, initiated by the Ivorian government with support from UNFPA, was designed to help young people stay in school. Central to the programme is comprehensive sexuality education, which provides students with age-appropriate information about the human body, sexual and reproductive health, and the consequences of early pregnancy. The curriculum also addresses human rights issues, including gender-based violence and child marriage. The campaign also provides students with information about, and access to, contraception. Dispelling myths is essential to helping young women avoid unplanned pregnancies. ""I did not take contraceptives because my mom told me that it might make me sterile,"" Amina explained. Clarissa, 22, said some girls are told that not becoming sexually active or not getting pregnant by age 15 or 16 ""is a problem."" UNFPA has also helped the government open a call centre providing free, confidential information. Trained operators respond to over 200 calls a day from around the country, with the majority of callers aged 11 to 18. Far from home Still, staying in school can be a trial. Many young people travel long distances just to attend.  Students at a secondary school inDaoukro attend a comprehensive sexuality education class.  UNFPA WCARO ""There are sometimes between 10,000 and 15,000 students in a city who come from elsewhere. They need housing, and boys and girls may share the same room,"" said Assoumou Kabran, of the Ministry of National Education and Technical Education. ""I came to live with my uncle in order to attend school, said Clarissa, who is from Bouake. She attended school in Daoukro, some 165 km away, and struggled with loneliness. Last year, she became pregnant, and was forced to return home. ""We must invest in education to enable them to live better,"" Mr. Kabran said, adding that the government is planning to build more schools with proper boarding facilities. Back on track Today, many girls who have become pregnant are working hard to return to school  they are no longer expelled for getting pregnant. Both Amina and Clarissa are now back in class, with help from their parents. My mom takes care of my baby when I come to school, Amina explained. Clarissa also left her son in the care of her mother. I lost a school year, she told UNFPA, but she has not abandoned her dreams. I want to become a teacher, she said.     "

Photo credit: UNFPA   09 July 2014   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka  Young people hold the keys to the future; unlocking their potential will lead to a better world for everyone. These facts are supported by mounting evidence from Sri Lanka, where UNFPA has worked with policymakers and other partners to support and empower youth. Like much of Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka began to experience a demographic dividend  a potential economic boom that occurs when falling fertility rates coincide with a growing working-age population  around two decades ago, according to a recent publication, Investing in the Demographic Dividend: Successes, Challenges and Way Forward for Sri Lanka. The report, co-authored by the Colombo-based Institute of Policy Studies and the UNFPA office in Sri Lanka, showed that investments in health and education have generated benefits for youth, and that further investments are needed to consolidate these gains. Investing in young people is the theme of this year's World Population Day, on 11 July. Health investments Demographic dividends are critical periods for investing in young people. It is estimated that the onset of the demographic transition started in 1992 and [will last] till 2037, said the report, which was launched in May at the World Conference on Youth in Colombo.  UNFPA Representative in Sri Lanka Alain Sibenaler speaks about investing in young people. Photo credit: UNFPA Since the 1970s, UNFPA has worked with partners, including policymakers, in Sri Lanka to improve the quality of maternal and newborn care, increase access to sexual and reproductive health services, and promote education and programmes for youth. Sustained and increased investments in sexual and reproductive health services [have] tremendous benefits to women, families and societies, the report indicates. These services have helped bring about one of the lowest maternal mortality rates in South Asia, with 38.6 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the publication. Such interventions do not simply save lives  they also contribute to families overall well-being, which can lead to a host of other benefits. In addition to improved health, sexual and reproductive health services contribute to economic growth, societal and gender equity, and democratic governance, the report says. Investments in education The country has also benefitted from increased investments in education, with a significant increase in [the] number of teachers in government schools taking place between 2007 and 2012. The enrolment rates in primary and junior secondary school have reached 95 per cent and 93 per cent respectively, the report says.   Sivagnanaselvan Dinesh receives a certificate of achievement from a senior education official in Jaffna District.Photo credit: UNFPA/Triad  Life was not easy, Sivagnanaselvan Dinesh told UNFPA. We often sacrificed luxuries in food and clothing to stay afloat. Mr. Dinesh, who grew up in war-affected Jaffna, was interviewed as part of Generation Youth: Yielding the Returns on Investments, a publication showcasing the stories of young leaders in the country. Despite our hardships, I was always determined to turn things around. The key to my success lay in... quality education, he said. Mr. Dinesh is now a medical student, and he looks forward to giving back to his community when completes his training. Work remains Still, much work remains to be done. While health and family planning programmes are available around the country through a decentralized field health system, resources are often scarcer in districts that were affected by conflict and in poor, rural areas. Female empowerment  including economic empowerment  also remains a priority. It has been estimated that raising female employment levels to that of male levels could have a direct impact on GDP However, the latest available data and indicators reflect that gender equality in Sri Lanka is not as satisfactory as its achievements in other human development indicators, according to the report. Ultimately, the future of the country, and the world, rests on the fate of young people. Youth are not demanding support, said Ahmad Alhendawi, the UN Secretary-Generals Special Envoy on Youth, who attended the launch of the report. They are asking for investments."

UNFPA/Koye Adeboye  20 September 2016   UNITED NATIONS, New York/BAGRE, Burkina Faso  Presidents, ministers, and United Nations and World Bank officials met yesterday at UN Headquarters in New York to strengthen their commitments for the young people of Africa. The continent is undergoing a seismic shift in its population structure, with more young people than ever before preparing to enter adulthood and the workforce. More than 30 per cent of Africas population is between the age of 10 and 24, and will remain so for at least the next 20 years, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement prepared for the event. With the right investments, these trends could be the regions greatest asset.  Aminata Loure in Bagre, Burkina Faso. She has received information about family planning, girls' empowerment, education and ending child marriage from an economic empowerment centre, part of a partnership designed to promote a demographic dividend.  UNFPA Burkina Faso/Bndicte Bama When the numbers of working-age people surpass the numbers of dependents, countries can experience an economic boom, a phenomenon known as a demographic dividend. But first, young people must be enabled to contribute to their countries and communities. We have estimates that show that if we do this, and we do it right, we can actually add to the GDP of Africa  $500 billion every year for 30 years, said UNFPAs Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin. Its mind-blowing. In attendance, and leading the call for investments in young people, were President Patrice Talon of Benin, President Idriss Dby of Chad (chair of the African Union), President Faustin-Archange Touadra of the Central African Republic, President Peter Mutharika of Malawi, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Vice President Isatou Njie-Saidy of the Gambia and former President Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania. Chairing the session was President Roch Marc Christian Kabor of Burkina Faso. Ministers from Cte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Uganda, as well as UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova, the UN Secretary-Generals Envoy for Youth Ahmad Alhendawi, youth leaders and development officials also urged efforts to help achieve a demographic dividend. Investing in youth Chief among the investments needed are: education; access to sexual and reproductive health care, including voluntary family planning; and the empowerment of women and girls. Educated, healthy and productive young people have a better chance of breaking out of poverty and making positive contributions to their communities, said Erna Solberg, the prime minister of Norway. Girls, in particular, must be reached by these efforts. Millions of vulnerable girls face the twin scourges of child marriage and adolescent pregnancy, practices that force them to drop out of school, diminishing their future prospects.  Rwandan President Paul Kagame speaks about the need for empowering women and girls. To the left is Abdallah Albert Toikeusse Mabri, foreign affairs minister of Cote d'Ivoire. Behind him is UN Secretary-Generals Envoy for Youth Ahmad Alhendawi. UNFPA/Koye Adeboye Studies have been carried out, and it shows that Chad can benefit from a demographic dividend in a few years, provided we work on issues such as the empowerment of women and if we keep young girls in school, President Dby told those assembled. Promises in action These efforts are already taking shape in many countries. In the village of Bagre, in Burkina Faso, a womens economic development centre is providing a broad range of services to empower women and young people. These include credit, training programmes, as well as information sessions. Our role is to reach out to women about family planning and then make available contraceptives, Lydia Lingani, a peer educator, told UNFPA during a recent visit. Peer educators also spread word about the importance of antenatal care, girls education and ending child marriage. When Aminata Loure, a mother of five, began frequenting the centre, she was planning to marry off her 14-year-old daughter Marceline. Peer educators convinced her to cancel these plans. Our decision was not easy, Ms. Loure said. We have suffered prejudice and misunderstanding around us But when you clearly understand all the problems your daughter could suffer if she is married too early, then your conscience cannot allow the sacrifice. Both mother and daughter are now fully committed to Marcelines education.  Marceline, second from the right, says she wants to be a doctor. She and her friends work in the rice fields during their school break.  UNFPA Burkina Faso/Bndicte Bama My mother took me to her centre for a training on how to avoid early pregnancy, Marceline told UNFPA, while standing ankle-deep in a rice paddy. I work in the rice field during vacation. I spend all day here. I will use the money I earn to attend school next year. No longer destined for early marriage, she is dreaming big: What I want is to stay in school, finish high school, and become a doctor, she said. Missed opportunity would be very, very costly The Bagre economic centre is one of many programmes supported by the Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) project  a partnership of UNFPA, the World Bank, and the governments of Burkina Faso, Chad, Cte d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. We have made tremendous strides together since establishing the SWEDD partnership, Dr. Osotimehin said at the UN meeting. But our work is not finished. The problem is known. What needs to be done is known, said President Kagame. If the right investments are not made, a tremendous opportunity could be lost. Changes in population size and age structure are not visible on a daily or yearly basis, which is why they are easy to miss, said Keith Hansen, vice president for the World Bank Group. But they are very, very costly to ignore."

NA,"press","17 November 2014","    Press Release  Worlds 1.8 Billion Young Can Propel Socioeconomic Development, New UNFPA Report Shows 17 November 2014    UNITED NATIONS, New YorkDeveloping countries with large youth populations could see their economies soar, provided they invest heavily in young peoples education and health and protect their rights, according to The State of World Population 2014, published today by UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund. The potential economic gains would be realized through a demographic dividend, which can occur when a countys working age population is larger than the population that is dependent and younger, the report shows. But to maximize the dividend, countries must ensure their young working-age populations are equipped to seize opportunities for jobs and other income-earning possibilities. Todays record 1.8 billion young people present an enormous opportunity to transform the future, says UNFPA Executive Director, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehim. Young people are the innovators, creators, builders and leaders of the future. But they can transform the future only if they have skills, health, decision-making, and real choices in life, he adds. With the right policies and investments in human capital, countries can empower young people to drive economic and social development and boost per-capita incomes, the new UNFPA report states. The UNFPA Executive Director urges countries in pursuit of a demographic dividend to ensure the gains result in growth that benefits everyone. It is too easy to talk about the demographic dividend in terms of money, savings and economic growth, which have so far excluded many, Dr. Osotimehin says. The demographic dividend must be harnessed to achieve inclusive growth and offer opportunities and well-being for all. In the 1950s and 1960s, several East Asian economies invested heavily in young peoples capabilities and in expanding their access to voluntary family planning, enabling individuals to start families later and have fewer children. The result was unprecedented economic growth. The Republic of Korea, for example, saw its per-capita gross domestic product grow about 2,200 per cent between 1950 and 2008. Nine in ten of the worlds young people today live in less developed countries. Because of lagging social services, these countries face greater obstacles to leveraging the advantages that can result from engaging a youthful, productive workforce. The UNFPA report shows that demographic shifts taking place in about 60 countries are opening a window for a demographic dividend. The size of the dividend depends largely on how those countries invest in young people to realize their full potential. If sub-Saharan African countries repeated the East Asian experience by making the right investments in young people, enabling them to participate in decisions that affect their lives and adopting policies to bolster economic growth, the region as a whole could realize a demographic dividend amounting to as much as $500 billion a year, for 30 years. A demographic dividend of this magnitude has the potential to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and raise living standards and catapult economies forward, the report states. Critical youth investments needed to reap a demographic dividend are those that protect rights, including reproductive rights, improve health, including sexual and reproductive health, and provide skills and knowledge to build young peoples capabilities and agency. These investments can also accelerate fertility declines, which can in turn accelerate the demographic transition.

NA,"evaluation-unfpa-support-population-dynamics-and-data","2023"," The evaluation assesses UNFPA support to population data, dynamics and development, from 2014 to 2022. This is the first evaluation of this theme at UNFPA and includes a specific focus on the demographic dividend, population ageing and low fertility. The evaluation provides evidence and lessons to inform the mid-term review of the UNFPA strategic plan 2022-2025 and the design of evidence-based population policies, programmes and strategies.      The evaluation finds that UNFPA delivers relevant and timely support to population data, dynamics and development work, including a robust focus on population and housing census and strengthening national and subnational data systems. Human rights and gender have been integrated consistently and strongly across population and development work, however, other megatrends such as migration and climate change are less coherent. UNFPA has strategically positioned and mainstreamed demographic dividend at various levels. Although ageing and low fertility are increasingly incorporated into UNFPA work, the organization should explicitly articulate how these issues relate to its organizational priorities. To strongly position UNFPA as a population data agency, the current structure and capacity of population and development work need to be enhanced.    The evaluation recommends creating a fit-for-purpose population and development strategy that centers on data, dynamics and development, including demographic dividend, resilience and policy. The strategy should link to UNFPA priorities, especially in relation to emerging demographic shifts as a mega-trend. UNFPA should promote internal capacities and learning on the demographic dividend, resilience and policy, and continue investments in its population data portal. UNFPA should also develop a corporate data strategy and data quality assurance capacity. The organization should also enhance the human and technical capacity of the population and development work.  #PopulationEval   "

With proper investment in their education, health, human rights and welfare, these countries could see their economies soar, the report says. This is because when a countrys working age population is larger than its number of dependents, it can reap a demographic dividend  an economic boom in which households are better able to save and invest and economies are more productive. But to maximize this dividend, countries must ensure young people entering the work force are equipped to make the most of the opportunities before them. To do this, countries must do more to protect human rights, including reproductive rights, improve health, including sexual and reproductive health, and provide skills and knowledge to build young peoples capabilities and agency. Today, nine in 10 of the worlds 1.8 billion young people live in less developed countries, where the young encounter obstacles to their rights  to education, to health, to live free from violence. Many of these young people may never realize their full potential, as leaders, as change-agents, as entrepreneurs, as people with the power to transform the future, Dr. Osotimehin said. Lifting hundreds of millions from poverty In the 1950s and 1960s, several East Asian countries invested heavily in their youth and expanded access to voluntary family planning, enabling people to start families later and have fewer children. As fertility rates fell, there were fewer dependents and more resources available to create or expand businesses, build infrastructure and make productive investments. The result was unprecedented economic growth.       The Republic of Korea, for example, saw its per-capita gross domestic product grow about 2,200 per cent between 1950 and 2008. Thailands GDP grew 970 per cent. Today, demographic shifts are taking place in about 60 countries, creating the conditions for a demographic dividend, The State of World Population states. If sub-Saharan African countries are able to repeat the East Asian experience, the region could realize a demographic dividend amounting to as much as $500 billion a year for 30 years. A demographic dividend of this magnitude could lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and catapult economies forward, the report states. Investing in young people But it all depends on empowering young people to realize their full potential.  Youth activists share information on preventing HIV during a World AIDS Day event in Tblisi, Georgia. Photo credit: UNFPA Georgia It is too easy to talk about the demographic dividend in terms of money, savings and economic growth, which have so far excluded many, Dr. Osotimehin said. The demographic dividend must be harnessed to achieve inclusive growth and offer opportunities and well-being for all. Currently, over 500 million young people survive on less than $2 per day, and 57 million school-aged youth are not able to obtain an education. As much as 60 per cent of young people in developing regions are neither in school not working, or have only irregular employment. And young peoples health is also at risk: They are disproportionately affected by HIV, and complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the second-leading cause death among adolescent girls and young women. Reaping the demographic dividend means tearing down barriers to their accessing key services, especially sexual and reproductive health care and information, said Dr. Osotimehin. Without these essential services, young people cannot protect themselves from HIV, cannot prevent an unintended pregnancy, cannot have control over their own bodies. He added, How we meet the needs and aspirations of young people and enable them to enjoy their rights will define our common future.  "

But to do this, countries must invest in young people. Students in Cotonou, Benin.  UNFPA Benin/Ollivier Girard  01 June 2015   UNITED NATIONS, New York  Young people are increasingly recognized as critical actors in matters of global importance. ""I place great hope in their power to shape our future,United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told leaders and dignitaries at today'sHigh-Level Event on the Demographic Dividend and Youth Employment, held at UN Headquarters in New York. Much the world is poised experience a demographic dividend  the economic growth that can occur when a population shifts from one with many dependents and comparatively few working-age people to one of many working-age people with fewer dependents. Demographic dividends have helped produce unprecedented economic growth in several East Asian countries. The Republic of Korea, for example, saw its per-capita gross domestic product grow about 2,200 per cent between 1950 and 2008.  But, as Egypts Minister of Population Dr. Hala Youssef told the policymakers and leaders present, The demographic dividend is not automatic... It is a window of opportunity. Igniting the potential of 1.8 billion To realize the dividend, countries must invest in the empowerment, education and employment of their young people. There are 1.8 billion young people in the world today, representing a staggering amount of human potential. Yet too many of them are trapped in poverty, with few opportunities to learn or to earn a decent living.  Policymakers, dignitaries and leaders convened in New York to discuss ways to help countries achieve a demographic dividend. Photo/Martin Dixon We all appreciate the massive waste of human capital in our world when 74 million young people cannot find work, said Mr. Ban. Young people are hungry for better options. They are rejecting the status quo and demanding a better future. Many of them are claiming their right to a decent living, and they are willing to take risks to do so. We have seen in recent times the high numbers of young people taking risks around the Mediterranean, trying to reach a better life, said Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA. But if these youth are allowed to realize their full potential, developing countries could see huge economic gains. The more young people grow into well-educated adults with fewer dependants and new opportunities to acquire wealth, savings and purchasing power, the more they will be able to accelerate economic growth and development, said Sam K. Kutesa, President of the 69th Session of the General Assembly, who convened the high-level event with support from UNFPA and the International Labour Organization. It is estimated the African continent could add up to about $500 billion per year to its economy for as many as 30 years, Mr. Kutesa added.  The world now has 1.8 billion young people. With the right investments, they can transform the world.Peer educators in Tajikistan. UNFPA/Nozim Kalandarov Steps towards a better future There are clear steps that can help countries achieve a demographic dividend. Increasing investment in young people is key. This includes promoting quality education that prepares them for future opportunities.A diversity of training will be needed  from quality primary and secondary schools to technical training, to two-year colleges and to research-intensive universities,"" said Dr. Osotimehin. Also essential is empowering women and girls, and ensuring their sexual and reproductive health and human rights, he noted. This would enable them to determine when and whom to marry and the number of their children. When women and girls are able to make these decisions, they are better able to complete their educations and pursue jobs. Countries must also increase employment opportunities for young people. Daniel Johnson, Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture of the Bahamas, stressed this point. Many young people will be forced to sit on margins of society, waiting on the train track for a train that may never come, he said, referring to the lack of employment options available in many communities. There is also a critical need to involve young people in decisions that will affect them. We cannot talk about sustainable development without the active involvement of youth, Mr. Ban said, adding: When we give young people decent jobs, political weight, negotiating muscle, and real influence in our world, they will create a better future. Let us take these ideas forward to harness the demographic dividend, holding human rights, gender equality, human capital, and dignity at the center of all our investments, Dr. Osotimehin said at the close of the event. Only by ensuring opportunities that open the future to all young people do we create a better future."
NA,"press","17 October 2016","    Statement  Access to quality sexual and reproductive health care can help end extreme poverty 17 October 2016   Statement of UNFPA Executive Director, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, 17 October 2016 To eradicate poverty  like any other goal to improve the human condition  we need to fully understand the worlds demographics. Poor countries with burgeoning youth populations may find it difficult to meet many of our global development goals, as they face more people entering primary and secondary school age, more people looking for health care, and many more entering labour markets, looking for productive jobs in the coming years. Yet, demographic trends can also create huge opportunities for accelerated economic and social development, if countries make the right investments in their young people, particularly adolescent girls, so that they can enjoy their human rights and achieve their potential. Access to quality sexual and reproductive health care, including voluntary family planning, can reduce maternal deaths by one third, and child deaths by as much as one fifth. Many families may choose to have fewer children, which reduces fertility levels. And when countries age structures change favourably, meaning that they have more people of working age than dependents, they can see a boost to development, known as a demographic dividend, provided that they empower, educate and employ their young people. With fewer dependents to support, parents can invest more in each child, have healthier children and spend more time earning money. By doing so, they will be able to speed up economic growth and social development, and create the conditions for raising living standards and reducing poverty. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls for the total eradication of extreme poverty, building on the success of the Millennium Development Goals in halving it. UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, is helping countries bring about the demographic dividend by empowering often-overlooked young people, especially girls, and protecting their rights. So the theme of this years International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, Moving from humiliation and exclusion to participation: ending poverty in all its forms, is at the heart of our work. Investing in the sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girls is the cornerstone to realizing a demographic dividend. More and more countries are declaring their ambition to move in this direction, which will lead to accelerated social and economic development and higher living standards. UNFPA is fully committed to supporting these efforts. Delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person can reach their potential will not only allow women and girls to exercise their fundamental rights; it will also help countries speed up their demographic transition and create the conditions for reaping the demographic dividend and ending poverty for every woman, man and child.

NA,"press","28 August 2016","    Press Release  African leaders, partners commit to actions to empower youth, women to transform Africa 28 August 2016   NAIROBI -- African, Japanese and other leaders at the Sixth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD VI), in Nairobi, agreed today on more international actions to empower youth and women to achieve a demographic dividend and transform Africa. By the Nairobi Declaration they adopted at the end of their two-day summit, they stated that they would speed-up efforts to develop skills through education, technical and vocational training, to promote social transformation. We emphasize that youth empowerment and capacity development are central to achieving demographic dividends, preventing forced migration and conflict and promoting peacebuilding, they declared. Heads of State, governments and delegations from 54 African countries, Japan, 74 international organizations and 52 other partners attended the conference. The leaders underscored the importance of universal health coverage, including access to sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, bearing in mind womens and girls rights. More than 30 per cent of Africa is aged 10-24 years  and this will continue until at least 2060. Their health and productivity will make or break demographic dividend for Africa, Dr. Natalia Kanem, Deputy Executive Director (Programme) of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund said. It is vital and urgent to invest in Africas human capital, especially its women and young people, to change Africas economic and development pictures quicker. For example, Dr. Kanem continued, it is estimated that girls completing secondary school in Kenya would add about $27 billion to the economy over their lifetimes. And if sub-Saharan Africa repeated the experience of some East Asian nations by making the right investments in young people, it could realize a demographic dividend of about $500 billion a year, for 30 years. She spoke at TICAD-related events on the demographic dividend and maternal health. We need to continuously address the development challenge of adolescent girls who are affected by unwanted pregnancies, leading to unsafe abortions, child marriage, sexual exploitation and gender-based violence, Dr. Kanem continued. We cannot achieve true social transformation without ensuring that the risk and vulnerabilities of adolescent girls are addressed. The Nairobi Declaration emphasized the need for efforts to increase global funding to strengthen country- and community-led health systems to ensure services to all individuals throughout their lives. It was necessary, they stressed, to mobilize more partners, especially the private sector, academia and civil society organizations, to provide education and expand youth and womens employment in Africa. The participants also adopted an implementation plan which would, among others, promote comprehensive care in reproductive, maternal and adolescent health by strengthening health workers capacity and improving access to family planning.

Girls in Niger. Photo credit: OCHA/David Ohana  22 September 2014    UNITED NATIONS, New York  With significant investments in the education of young girls, sexual and reproductive health for youth and adolescents, as well as womens empowerment in our counties, we will change the face of the Sahel, President of Chad Idriss Dby said at the United Nations today, during a high-level panel on the potential of young people to drive economic growth in the Sahel region of Africa. Only by investing in the skills and rights of young people  particularly adolescent girls  can the region take advantage of a demographic dividend, a key opportunity to improve livelihoods and living standards, the leaders present said. A demographic dividend occurs when falling fertility rates lead to a large working-age population with fewer dependents and, therefore, more household income. Demographic dividends played a major role in the economic ascension of Asian countries like the Republic of Korea and India between the 1960s and 2000s.  Panellists discuss the demographic dividend. From left to right: Moderator Femi Oke, UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, World Bank Vice-President Makhtar Diop, President of Cte dIvoire Alassane Ouattara, President of Niger Mahamadou Issoufou, President of Chad Idriss Dby, and Melinda Gates, co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Photo credit: UNFPA/Omar Kasrawi Today, Africa, with the fastest-growing and youngest population in the world, is poised to reap similar benefits, said the panel, which included President Dby, President of Cte dIvoire Alassane Ouattara, President of Niger Mahamadou Issoufou, UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, World Bank Vice-President Makhtar Diop, and Melinda Gates, co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. But the dividend is not automatic. It requires a healthy, educated workforce with access to decent jobs. This means investing in the health, rights and skills of young people  especially adolescent girls, who remain marginalized in large numbers throughout the Sahel and the world. ""Evidence show that the demographic transition can happen in one generation."" Ms. Gates said. ""But it is only going to happen if we make significant investment."" Girls, women left behind Unfortunately, the places where it is most critical to make these investments are the places where it is hardest to do so, such as in the Sahel. Although the region has experienced economic growth and declining infant mortality rates, living standards remain poor and opportunities are few. Approximately half the population lives on less than $1.25 a day, and fertility rates are among the highest in the world. Conditions are particularly stark for women and girls. Too few girls attend secondary school, and child marriage is tolerated in too many communities, contributing to higher rates of adolescent pregnancy and maternal mortality.Investments key The next steps are clear: Universal education, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and gender equality are known to facilitate the economic productivity of young people while also promoting their safety, dignity and quality of life. Burkina Faso, Chad, Cte dIvoire, Mali, Mauritania and Niger  these countries have started the demographic transition, and international support can help to accelerate the process, Dr. Osotimehin told the panel. Already, these nations have registered remarkable progress in reducing child mortality. Now we will work to reduce maternal mortality, child marriage and the unmet need for family planning. He added: Evidence suggests that family planning can and should play a much larger role in development in the Sahel. The returns on investment are enormous: less maternal and child deaths, savings in health care costs, and acceleration of the demographic transition to reap a dividend of higher inclusive economic growth. Family planning allows that virtuous cycle to happen, Ms. Gates emphasized. Investing in a woman, putting her at the centre, gets you change at the village level, and then at the level of the full economy of a country, she noted. And girls' education cannot be overlooked, President Issoufou added. ""We must keep our girls at school as long as possible, including by providing scholarships to the poorest girls and their families."" Taking action The World Bank and UNFPA, through the $200 million Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographics Project, are improving access to sexual and reproductive health, especially voluntary family planning and maternal health. The programme is also improving child health and nutrition, strengthening girls education, and working to ending child marriage. These efforts will involve close partnerships with governments, as well as with other UN agencies, non-governmental organizations and community groups. But further changes are also required. Policies and investments are needed in the short-term, says a statement of the Bill & Melinda Gates Institute for Population and Reproductive Health and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, signed by public health experts and economists from around the world. Timing is key, said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in a video statement shown at the event. The Sahels best window of opportunity is now through the next 15 years We cannot lose this historic opportunity to transform the region.

Demographic dividend  a window of opportunity Africa is young; in 15 sub-Saharan African countries, half the population is under 18, according to the 2014 State of World Population Report. Countries with high proportions of young people are poised to benefit from a so-called demographic dividend, an economic boom that can occur when there are more people of working age than dependents. Presidents, vice presidents and ministers at the meeting pledged to work together to achieve a demographic dividend in their countries. We have committed ourselves to investing in the realization of the potential of Africas youth population, said Zambian President Edgar Lungu. These investments will be needed in education, skills training and health care. Countries must also invest in improving the rights and welfare of young people so they are able to seize and create opportunities. Ensuring access to education, health services and employment for youth can mean the difference between capitalizing on a demographic dividend or taking a road towards disempowerment and disaffection, said Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, UNFPAs Executive Director, delivering the meetings keynote address. Empowered young people are already making enormous contributions. They are leading on global actions, such as ending discrimination, connecting Africa with digital innovations and technology, ensuring our collective resilience in the face of climate change, and building peace, Dr. Osotimehin said.  In Malawi, Luwiza (second from right) prepares to speak to a crowd of girls about the importance of learning and fulfilling their potential. UNFPA Malawi Unlocking the potential of adolescent girls But the greatest gains will take place when the most vulnerable young people  adolescent girls  see their potential unlocked. Adolescent girls, in particular, if they can be ensured high-quality education and primary health care, and if they are no longer burdened by child marriage, gender-based violence, unplanned pregnancies, poor maternal and newborn health, or HIV, can generate a better future for themselves and their families  and a dividend for their country, Dr. Osotimehin said. Luwiza, in Malawi, is proving this point. After giving birth in the rural district of Dedza, she attended Safeguard Young People, a UNFPA-supported youth programme. There, she learned about her rights and how to access health care, including sexual and reproductive health care such as family planning. She also learned the importance of continuing her education. She has since refused to become a child bride, which is often the fate of girls who become pregnant in Malawi. And despite ridicule from members of her community, she has successfully returned to school. She now shares her story with other girls, inspiring them to pursue their own ambitions. My school friends used to tease me, and some were saying I should go home to cook and take care of my child, Luwiza recently told a crowd of girls in Dedza. She refuses to let these insults bother her. Instead, she is focused on her future, her familys future, and the future children of Malawi. My vision is to get educated, get a job as a secondary school teacher and take better care of my child, she said."

NA,"press","11 November 2013","Press Release  World Bank Group, UNFPA, Pledge to Improve Maternal and Reproductive Health of Women and Adolescent Girls in Africas Sahel Region 11 November 2013   NIAMEY, NigerA new regional initiative by the World Bank Group and UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, will improve maternal and reproductive health and address issues related to adolescent girls in the Sahel. The Banks $200 million Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographics Projectwhich builds on its existing $150 million in commitments over the next two years for maternal and child health in the regionwill improve the availability and affordability of reproductive health commodities, strengthen specialized training centres for rural-based midwifery and nursing services, and pilot and share knowledge on adolescent girls initiatives. Of the Banks new funding, $100 million has been committed to UNFPA, which will help to create the preconditions for a demographic dividend by addressing fertility levels, population growth, gender equality and access to reproductive health commodities and services. The goal is to accelerate the regions economic and social development and strengthen the resilience of its people, communities and countries. The new funding was announced during last weeks visit to Niger by a high-level delegation composed of the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, UNFPA Executive Director, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, and World Bank President, Dr. Jim Yong Kim. The delegation also included European Union Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgs, African Union Commission Chairperson, Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, and African Development Bank President, Donald Kaberuka. The visit was part of a four-day mission to the Sahel intended to promote regional security, resilience and development. The Niger visit focused on the countrys maternal and reproductive health and its growing fertility rate. Niger continues to stand alone as the country with the highest fertility rate in the world; its population of more than 17 million is increasing by 3.4 per cent per year. Too many children still die, too many mothers are lost to complications of childbirth, and too few girls are in secondary school. So we need to do much more, said Nigers President Mahamadou Issoufou. This high population growthfurther complicated by the youth bulgecreates huge challenges in terms of demand for social services, including education, where girls pay the highest cost. The spread of gender-based violence also has significant social and economic costs for women and girls. As one of the worlds poorest, most fragile countries, Niger is also highly vulnerable to droughts and prone to political instability, leaving a large portion of its population without food security. Building stability and resilience in countries like Niger is vital to the peace and stability of sub-Saharan Africa. The World Bank Group and UNFPA recognize that achieving the demographic dividend is essential for inclusive social, economic and sustainable development. It is also critical to decreasing the fragility of the Sahel countries and to strengthening their health systems, improving girls education, tackling social norms that favour harmful cultural practices and other barriers that hinder gender equality and ensuring other social and economic policies are in place. The challenges of the Sahel respect no bordersneither should our solutions, said the UN Secretary-General. These challenges cannot be overcome by any government or organization alone. The issues are connected and we need an approach that connects our efforts. High fertility, rapid population growth and a large youth population present unique challenges in the Sahel. Where choices improve for women and girls, fertility declines and opportunities expand, said Dr. Osotimehin. Raising the age of marriage, keeping girls in school, enabling women through family planning to decide the spacing and number of their children, and investing in the health and education of young people, particularly young girls, can unlock a powerful demographic dividend and set countries in the Sahel on the path to sustained, inclusive social and economic growth. The time to act is now. Gender-based violence (GBV) will also be a key entry point to addressing the complex, multi-dimensional challenges facing the Sahels women and girls. GBV is a primary intervention of UNFPAs work, both as a stand-alone focus and as an integratedand criticalelement of the Funds work in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, advancing gender equality, ensuring the rights of adolescent girls, engaging men and boys, and promoting the use of high-quality population data to drive evidence-based programmes. Eliminating such violence in countries like Niger produces significant social and economic benefits for women and girls, which can help build stability and resilience in the Sahels communities and countries. Efforts of the World Bank/UNFPA regional initiative will focus on countries furthest behind in their demographic transitions, and where there is greatest opportunity to realize a demographic dividend. A rights-based, gender-responsive, pro-youth and pro-adolescents approach will be undertaken in implementing this programme. As we work towards ending poverty across the developing world, we know that educating adolescent girls and getting health services to women will lead to greater prosperity not just for individual families but also for entire economies, said Dr. Kim. This link is even more critical when countries, such as those of the Sahel, have fast-growing youth populations and are trying to make timely investments to reap a major set of economic gains known as the demographic dividend. UNFPA, which is deeply engaged in the Sahel, intends to strengthen its role with this new initiative. The Fund remains committed to working with partners to improve womens reproductive health and girls education, which would go a long way in establishing the regions stability and security. UNFPA brings to this partnership its leadership on issues related to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, gender-based violence, gender equality and its advocacy for most affected populations in humanitarian and transition countries. The World Bank has a strong track record in helping countries respond to crisis and strengthening resilience, as well as in longer term reconstruction and development planning.

UNFPA/Rick Francis  08 February 2017   ADDIS ABABA/RWAMANGANA  Marie Josee Mukankuranga stood before international health and development experts in her home in the Rwamagana District of Rwanda, talking about her communitys need for family planning. Ms. Mukankuranga, a community health worker, explained that villagers visit her to learn about modern contraception. I am following up with 35 to 40 clients, she told them. Programmes like these receive little attention, but they are critically important. Voluntary family planning empowers women to choose if and when to have children, and how many. It enables women to finish their educations and join the labour force, helping families rise out of poverty and securing better futures for their children. Human rights and development imperative Family planning is not only a human right; it is also a development imperative. In Africa, which has large numbers of young people, family planning can play a central role in helping to harness a so-called demographic dividend.  It is ""unthinkable"" to achieve a demographic dividend without providing women with access to family planning, UNFPA's Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin said at the AU Summit event. UNFPA Ethiopia/Meron Negash A demographic dividend is a massive economic boom that can take place when there is a decline in fertility rates, yielding fewer dependents relative to income-generators. Voluntary family planning programs, information and services are essential to this process. Investments are also needed to create a better access to education and decent employment, and to help ensure gender equality. If you dont have a working family planning programme, it is unthinkable to reap the demographic dividend, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, Executive Director of UNFPA, said at a high-level event organized at the margins of the 2017 Summit of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The event, which focused on the importance of ensuring access to voluntary family planning, was jointly organized by UNFPA, the United Kingdoms Department for International Development (DFID) and the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia. There has since been significant progress in providing access to voluntary family planning throughout Africa since 2012. That year, governments and partners committed to reaching 120 million more girls and women with modern contraceptives by 2020, a promise known as FP2020. But the continent still has the highest rate of adolescent pregnancy in the world, with some five million girls lacking access to modern contraceptives, according to a 2013 UNFPA report. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth also remain a key cause of death for girls aged 15-19 years in Africa. Priti Patel, Secretary of State for DFID, emphasized that an estimated 225 million women globally want to avoid or delay pregnancy but are not using modern contraceptives. These women, she said, must be reached with voluntary family planning. She also announced that a family planning summit will be convened this summer in London, a joint effort between the UK government, UNFPA, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and other key partners.  Some 225 million women want to avoid or delay pregnancy but are not using modern contraceptives, DFID Secretary of State Priti Patel said at the event.  UNFPA Ethiopia/Meron Negash Do not want the neighbours to know Ambassador Olawale Maiyegun, Director of Social Affairs at the African Union Commission, underscored the need increase access to sexual and reproductive health services for young people, who too often face barriers to this kind of care. Ms. Mukankuranga knows this first-hand. In her practice in Rwanda, she says stigma keeps adolescents from visiting her. Instead, they travel further afield to health centres outside the community. Mostly young girls do not come here, she explained. They do not want that the neighbours know, she said. Despite these challenges, the community has seen an uptick in family planning. Women are gratified to receive the services, she noted. And it is rewarding for Ms. Mukankuranga, too. I like my job. When there are no complications, it really makes me happy, she said. "

During a historic trip to the region by leaders from five international organizations  the United Nations, the World Bank, the African Union, the African Development Bank, and the European Union  Dr. Kim announced the $200 million Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographics Project. The initiative, which builds on the Banks existing $150 million in commitments over the next two years for maternal and child health programmes in the Sahel, will work across the region to improve the availability and affordability of reproductive health commodities, strengthen specialized training centres for rural-based midwifery/nursing services, and to pilot and share knowledge on adolescent girls initiatives. While Niger and most of the countries in the Sahel have reduced child mortality significantly in recent years, maternal and child mortality levels remain high, as do fertility rates. This call to action on womens empowerment and demographics is not simply about numbers. It is about people. When women and girls have the tools to shape their own future, they will advance development for all, said Mr. Ban, who is on his second joint visit to Africa with the World Bank chief. He cited the need to not only take steps to support women, but also the need to change mindsets. Women should be able to demand their rights. But I also want men to join this call. Help us create conditions where your daughters, your sisters and your wives have full equality. Help us create a society where women never have to fear violence at the hands of men. Help us create families where mothers and fathers decide together how many children they want to have. The time to do this is now, he stated at the launch of the new initiative.  UNFPA Executive Director Babatunde Osotimehin (left) and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Niamey, Niger.UNFPA is set to receive funding based on country requests for reproductive health commodities and services in the Sahel region.UNFPA will receive Photo  UN Photo/Mark Garten I have full confidence that the men of Niger and the Sahel can support the women here, and that together you can open a new future. Financed by the World Banks International Development Association (IDA)  its fund for the worlds poorest countries  the new programme will be closely coordinated with UN agencies and other development partners, and will build on existing investments and analyses of Africas demographic dividend already being supported by the World Bank Group. As we work towards ending poverty across the developing world, we know that educating adolescent girls and getting health services to women will lead to greater prosperity not just for individual families but also for entire economies, said Dr. Kim. This link is even more critical when countries, such as those of the Sahel, have fast-growing youth populations and are trying to make timely investments to reap a major set of economic gains known as the demographic dividend. Of the World Bank Groups $350 million for the womens empowerment and demographics programme  including the $200 million pledge made today  up to $100 million is expected to go to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). Much of the funding to the UNFPA will be based on country requests for reproductive health commodities and services. High fertility, rapid population growth and a large youth population present unique challenges in the Sahel. Where choices improve for women and girls, fertility declines and opportunities expand, said UNFPA Executive Director Babatunde Osotimehin. Raising the age of marriage, keeping girls in school, enabling women through family planning to decide the spacing and number of their children, and investing in the health and education of young people, particularly young girls, can unlock a powerful demographic dividend and set countries in the Sahel on the path to sustained, inclusive social and economic growth.

The event will make an important contribution to dealing with the crisis, building resilient communities in the sub-region and preserving their gains from the Millennium Development Goals, while helping affected countries pursue the upcoming Sustainable Development Goals. In Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, insurgents are exploiting the huge youth populations which, otherwise, could be assets for employment, innovation and development. It is a potential which, if combined with the right policies and demographic transitions, could provide the region with the opportunity to harness a demographic dividend that leads to rapid economic development. The demographic dividend is the accelerated economic growth that could result when a countrys working age population grows larger than the non-working dependents. While the crisis damages entire communities, women are particularly targeted. As of April 2015, more than 2,000 women and young girls have been abducted, according to Amnesty International. The UNFPA event, expected to be addressed by Heads of State of affected countries and leaders of international organizations, will offer an opportunity to propose strategic initiatives to support and empower young people and protect them from manipulation and radicalization.

UNFPA/Annette Poni  The Government of the Lombardy Region has approved 500,000 in support to UNFPA Supplies as part of the Italian region's overall commitment to expanding access to family planning in the least developed countries. Lombardys first standalone contribution to fund UNFPA operations follows a Regional Council resolutionand representsItalys first time to finance UNFPA Supplies. UNFPA Supplies is UNFPA's thematic fund dedicated to expanding access to contraceptives. It is critical to address the unmet need for family planning in the world's poorest countries. Support for modern family planning, which is a human right and must be voluntary,is widely regarded as a best buy for global development. Full access to contraceptives allows women and girlsto choose whether, when and how often to have children. So, more girls stay in school and more women have the opportunity to enter or stay in the workforce. Ultimately, families, communities and countries thrive as they reap the benefits of the demographic dividend contributing to socioeconomic growth, human rights and local development needs. For every $1 spent on family planning, governments can save up to $6  making voluntary family planning one of the most value-for-money investments available to donors. It is necessary to ensure safe and accessible reproductive and maternal health equipment and services for women in economically fragile countries. These interventions can limit the risk of maternal and neonatal mortality and offer women the opportunity to see their rights protected and freely develop positive life paths,""said Attilio Fontana, President of the Regional Government of Lombardy. The Lombardy Regional Council was represented at the recently concluded Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 by Regional Councilor Dr. Michele Usuelli. In Nairobi, many participants committed to end all unmet need for family planning by 2030 and endorsed the Nairobi Statement, which urges countries to draw on the demographic dividend to drive growth and achieve sustainable development."
NA,"press","03 April 2017","    Speech  Statement of Executive Director to the Commission on Population and Development 03 April 2017   Presented by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin to the 50th session of the Commission on Population and Development on changing population age structures and sustainable development. [As prepared for delivery] Madame Chairperson,Members of the Commission,Distinguished delegates,Ladies and gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to address this 50th Session of the Commission on Population and Development. As you know, the world has seen dramatic shifts in population and development since the Commission first met 70 years ago. A global revolution in health has improved child survival and added decades to average life expectancy. The invention of the pill and the proliferation of modern family planning services across the globe marked a major step forward for the empowerment of women and couples. The global average fertility rate has fallen by half. There are five billion more people on the planet, and they are increasingly urban and mobile. And this Commission  in assessing the implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action since 1994  has steadfastly advanced one of the most human rights-centered, aspirational, and integrated visions of human development ever. The ICPD shifted the field of population and development from a focus on population crisis, targets and numbers to one focused on human rights, sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and the empowerment of women. This shift foreshadowed the Millennium Development Goals, and the 2030 Agendas transformational focus on equality, inclusion and human rights. Changing Population Age Structure This year, we gather to discuss changing population age structure and how this affects the achievement of sustainable development. Overall  the world is ageing. In 1950, the median age of the worlds population was 23.5 years. Nows its almost 30, and by 2050 it will likely be over 36. Yet the status and pace of population ageing are very different between countries. Countries are further apart from one another in median age than ever before. Addressing Diversity between Countries These differences in age structure reflect differences in economic development and health  and remind us of countries very different starting points at the outset of the 2030 Agenda. Yet despite these differences, never have countries and their people been more connected  through the internet, markets, the flow of people, shared responsibilities in times of crisis, and recognition of environmental change on a global scale. This offers boundless opportunities for countries to work together, especially on demographic transition and the investments needed to advance health and human rights in both young and ageing countries, and further promote the implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action. The Secretary-Generals reports for this Commission celebrate many such examples of mutual learning and collaboration between countries. Uniting this Commission This Commission is united by the vision and values of the ICPD Programme of Action, echoed in the Key Actions of 1999, the ICPD Beyond 2014, and the 2030 Agenda  that sustainable development cannot be advanced without assuring the human rights and dignity of all people, at all ages, especially women and girls. We are united by our common aspirations to reduce discrimination against women. Despite all our progress, this discrimination is manifest daily in violence, trafficking, child marriage, female genital mutilation, maternal death and morbidity, a persistent gender wage gap, the double burden of work and family, and the poverty of older women. Across all countries, young and old, people must navigate transitions from childhood to adulthood to old age. Governments can enable or constrain those experiences. Ensuring that everyone can build their capabilities and shape their future means eliminating barriers faced by countless young people. These barriers include child, marriage, adolescent pregnancy, loss of schooling, poor sexual and reproductive health, and lack of control over their own bodies. It means finding ways to stem the drift towards informal work and exclusionary economic growth. It means providing opportunities for people, beginning in youth and extending across the age spectrum, to achieve their aspirations and balance work and family life. It means lifelong learning, since economies are changing and people maintain their capacity to learn and adapt throughout their lives. It means focusing on the overall ICPD agenda to ensure that older persons enjoy the blessings of a longer, healthier life. If the Commission is able to deliver on this, it sets the stage for each country to achieve transformational returns from their population age structure. Youthful Populations and the Demographic Dividend Let me speak now about how this focus can deliver rapid gains in sustainable development in countries with youthful populations. We are seeing high numbers of unemployed and systematically disempowered youth around the world, their lives destabilized by lack of opportunity and security. At the same time, young people worldwide have digital knowledge about global inequalities and the ways in which their rights are denied. In such contexts, young people are often perceived as threats to peace and security. The demographic dividend offers a fundamentally different way of viewing the prospects and pathways for sustainable development in countries with high proportions of young people. Expanded investments in empowerment, including in sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and quality education for adolescents and youth, have lifelong effects. And when such investments extend broadly across the population, they result in a surge of human capital. When this surge coincides with a demographic bulge of young people owing to declining fertility, the result is an especially high proportion of the population with better health and more education moving into its most productive years. If these young people are met with real opportunities for decent work, the demographic dividend of accelerated development can be reaped in the course of a generation. Ageing, Social Protection and the Second Demographic Dividend If we can truly deliver these rights and prospects for young people, they will be healthier and better off as they move through their working ages. The health of middle-aged and older persons, and their ability to continue to work and live long, productive lives, depends on the investments that they received earlier in life. A wealthier and healthier older population is well positioned to invest in the younger generation, continuing the positive cycle of advancing health, nutrition, education and opportunity. And again, the right investments can result in a sustained development boom amidst population ageing. This is known as the second demographic dividend. But first, we need to readjust our societies and expectations to lives that continue decades after what, in some countries, has been the traditional age of retirement. This means strengthening supports so that the burden of ageing is not placed on the backs of either older persons themselves, or women, who bear disproportionate responsibilities for the care of older people. It will be an ongoing project, for example, to balance adequate pensions with broad coverage and fiscal sustainability. In all of these efforts, our north star must be the needs, rights and capabilities of older persons. The Centrality of Population Data I would like to conclude by speaking about a keystone of the ICPD-based vision of development, now fully integrated within the 2030 Agenda, and a vital means for understanding and planning for changing population age structure: population data. The world is embarking on the 2020 round of censuses, in which we will endeavor to count every person on the planet. These data underpin all national development planning. Yet too many countries under-use their census, and fail to generate national or sub-national projections of their own population, which provide critical information on how age structure is changing, and where and when communities will age most quickly. Meeting our commitment to leave no one behind depends on population data. Let us come together at this Commission to collectively reflect on what these data are telling us, and what they mean for the future we want. Let us set a standard for shared, open information that can form the basis of collaborative, collective efforts to advance freedom and opportunity for all, at all ages, which is, in turn, the foundation for achieving sustainable development. UNFPA has played a critical role in advancing the work of the Commission over these many years, in partnership with the Secretariat, and we stand ready to continue this work together. Thank you.   "

NA,"press","03 October 2013","Press Release  African Ministers Urged to Lead on Issues of Freedom, Equality, Justice and Dignity in Future Development Agenda 03 October 2013   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia  As Ministers from across Africa gathered for the opening of the Ministerial Segment of the African Regional Conference on Population and Development, there was a clear acknowledgement that Africa has made considerable progress in the twenty years since the ICPD Programme of Action was adopted and a call for the continent to keep the moving forward. We have the opportunity to make history and achieve long sought after goals, said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, speaking at the opening session. Dr. Osotimehin urged African leaders to seize the moment and agree on a new action plan for the continent which would lead the way for the development agenda beyond 2015. Africa has made strides in governance, in educating our people, ameliorating acute poverty to some degree, reducing communicable diseases, recognizing and according our women the equality and security they are entitled to. But much more needs to be done, he said. Dr. Osotimehin underlined some of the Africas most pressing challenges including those related to the status of women and girls; ensuring universal access to basic health services, including sexual and reproductive health services; addressing the unmet need of some 47 million women in sub-Saharan Africa for family planning, as well as challenges related to urbanization, migration, complex emergencies and conflict, the environment, food insecurity and climate change. These challenges are linked in a vicious self-perpetuating cycle that must be broken, he stressed. The key to breaking the cycle and to realizing the vision of our founding fathers and of Cairo is the investment in the continents greatest asset  the African people, particularly our women and young people. Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn reinforced the enormous potential of Africas large youth population and stressed that the time to take advantage of that potential is now. If properly managed, the so-called youth bulge would represent a golden opportunity for many African countries to experience the demographic dividend, he said. The Prime Minister also highlighted the need for the effective implementation of the right policies and strategic investments in young people in order to create socially and economically productive adults. Achieving this demands a strong regional commitment to ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health programmes that include voluntary and comprehensive family planning information and services, he said. Furthermore, implementation of policies that ensure universal access to comprehensive healthcare, quality education including tertiary level education that promotes gender equality and eliminate early and forced marriage particularly for our young girls, are some of the seeds we must sow to reap the demographic dividend. Dr. Carlos Lopes, United Nations Under-Secretary General and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa said this is a moment of truth for Africa and he called for a structural transformation of the continent to be fueled by industrialization and job creation. Despite our exceptional demographic vitality, and even more astounding despite our 5% average growth, we are not capable of creating the 15 million jobs we need every year, he said. Dr. Lopes stressed that young people need to participate fully in decision-making processes to realize the dividend of Africas population dynamics. The Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Dr. Erasmus Mwencha encouraged delegates to prioritize their efforts to achieve a growth for Africa that is here to stay. The African Regional Conference on Population and Development is the fifth and final regional conference held to review the progress, towards the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action and to agree a forward looking agenda beyond 2014 that puts rights at the heart of the development. The review process will help identify strategic priorities in relation to population and development on the African Continent and will define the ICPD agenda post 2014, and contribute to the continent's position on the United Nations Post-2015 development agenda. The Conference is jointly organized by the African Union Commission, the UN Economic Commission for Africa and UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund.

UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin and representatives of the World Bank were joined by Ministers from Benin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Niger, who shared their experiences on issues that pose the greatest challenges to women, girls and youth in their countries. UNFPA and the World Bank Group are committed to working together to promote gender equality and womens empowerment in the Sahel and Great Lakes regions, said Dr. Osotimehin. I share the conviction with the leadership of the World Bank that this is the time to invest in Africa, particularly in young people, so that they can become the agents of peacebuilding and peacekeeping. During a historic visit to the Sahel by a high-level delegation in November 2013, the World Bank Group and UNFPA responded to the Niamey Call to Action where the Bank pledged $100 million to UNFPA to invest in womens empowerment and the demographic dividend  a linchpin of the UNFPA mandate. The demographic dividend refers to the potential economic growth that can be experienced as a result of changes in the age structure of a population following a decline in fertility, giving families and governments the opportunity to allocate more resources to meet the needs of the youngest generations and contributing to an increase in human capital, poverty reduction and more sustained economic growth. Earlier in the year, the Executive Director also joined the high-level mission to the Great Lakes Region where gender-based violence and other challenges that face women and girls, including reproductive health and rights and obstetric fistula, were among the key issues highlighted. The relationship between gender-based violence and the development and security agendas has become clear. What is required is a multi-dimensional response that not only addresses the needs of the survivors of gender-based violence, but also empowers women economically and through education, and addresses the culture of impunity that often characterizes these situations, said Ms. Trina Haque, Sector Manager for the World Bank Health, Nutrition and Population in West and Central Africa.  ""Teach boys it's not cool to violate women"": UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin speaks to UN Radio Violence against women and girls in the Great Lakes region can be reduced by empowering young people, and giving girls an education will help them learn more about their rights, says UNFPA's Executive Director. The Great Lakes region has been wracked by conflict in the past two decades. And sexual violence is still being used as a weapon of war in the region. A high-level panel was held on 10 March as part of the 58th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. LISTEN: UNFPA Executive Director speaks to UN Radio about the importance of teaching boys at a young age that it's not cool to violate women. Ultimately, it is about the status of women and girls, said Dr. Osotimehin, And this requires the participation of men on the ground everywhere. We must change attitudes towards women. Women can have education, skills and health, but beyond that they must be able to speak up and be politically active, he added. We cannot restrict our efforts to the Sahel and the Great Lakes, but must invest in Africa more broadly so its populations reap the benefits of its demographic dividend. I think that the renaissance of Africa is going to come from there. This years Commission on the Status of Women focuses on the Challenges and Achievements in the Implementation of the Millennium Development Goals for Women and Girls. As the 2015 deadline for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) draws near, the side-event offered an important opportunity to celebrate advancement in gender equality and to identify strategies to address the most important issues that confront women, girls and youth in Africa. The debate helped to ensure that issues of gender equality, the elimination of gender-based violence and demographics are considered in the post-2015 development agenda. The World Bank and UNFPA partnership represents a starting point to galvanize action around the complex challenges that face the Africas women, girls and youth beyond 2015. We recognize that we cannot achieve sustainable development in the Sahel or the Great Lakes Regions without addressing adverse norms that constrain womens agency and choice, said the Banks Director of Gender and Development Jeni Klugman. Our partnership with UNFPA reflects our commitment to continuing to invest in these regions and to convening partners around these complex challenges. -------- Speakers: H.E., Ms. Maikibi Kadidiatou Dandobi, Minister of Population, Promotion of Women and Protection of Children of Niger H.E., Mr. Antonin Dossou, Minister for the Evaluation of Public Policies and Denationalisation Programmes of Benin Ms. Trina S.

Photo credit: UN Photo/Marco Dormino  15 April 2014   UNITED NATIONS, New York  The growing number of young people in Africa could offer enormous potential gains to the continent, but only if their needs are met and their rights are fulfilled. This was the central message of leaders and public health experts at an 11 April meeting on Africas demographic dividend at the United Nations Headquarters. The population of young people is growing rapidly in Africa, even as numbers of young people are projected to decline in most other parts of the world, according to the recent UN Secretary-Generals report on world demographic trends. This fact, coupled with declining fertility rates, means Africa has the opportunity to benefit from a demographic dividend  a potential economic boom that occurs when falling fertility rates coincide with a growing working-age population. The discussion, a side event of the 2014 Commission on Population and Development, focused on how African countries can make the most of this opportunity. The key, said speakers, is to help young people fulfil their individual potential, empowering them to bring benefits to their communities, their countries and the world.  Dignitaries and health experts discuss support for Africa's youth. Photo credit: UNFPA/Eddie Wright In Africa, over 30 per cent of the population is between the age of 10 and 24, and will remain so for at least the next 20 years. This burgeoning youth population is a challenge for the region, but it also could be an opportunity  and our greatest asset, said Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, Executive Director of UNFPA, the UN Population Fund. Africas young people have the potential to be a powerful engine for development. But to realize this potential, we must invest in them, address their particular needs, include them in decision-making and empower them to become agents of change. Listening to young people Africa is home to the youngest and most productive population in the world, said Corinne Woods, Director of the UN Millennium Campaign. This is added to the fact that the fastest developing economies today are in Africa. And this presents enormous opportunities for growth and transformation. Africas present and future belong to its youths. She urged governments to be responsive to young peoples needs and demands. Surveys have shown that citizens understand what it will take to achieve socioeconomic transformation and human development. Added to this, they also appreciate the bottlenecks impeding their achievement of livelihood ambitions as well as the responsibilities of governments and other stakeholders to deal with these challenges, she said. Harnessing youthful energy is a sure pathway to peace, prosperity and growth, she added. Youth need the tools to succeed The UNFPAs Regional Director for West and Central Africa Benoit Kalasa warned that governments must do more to ensure young people have the opportunities and tools necessary to succeed. Employment opportunities are few, he said, adding, We need to empower women and ensure gender equality And we need jobs, jobs and jobs. Young women must not be left behind, Dr. Osotimehin noted: If Africa is to take advantage of this demographic transition, as other regions have done, we must invest specifically in our daughters and ensure that each young person and each adolescent girl has access to education and quality health care, including comprehensive sexuality education and reproductive health services. He also emphasized the importance of equipping young people with the knowledge needed to protect themselves from adolescent pregnancy and HIV. Every day we lose young women unnecessarily, and this has to stop, he said. The event was organized by the Permanent Mission of Nigeria to the UN, in collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation, Plan USA, the Ford Foundation and the UN Millennium Campaign. Participants at the event included UNFPA and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Healths Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population and Reproductive Health."

NA,"news","15 June 2016","News  The Very Important Girls Group: Investing in youth to invest in the future of Tanzania   The Action for Adolescent Girls initiative has reached thousands of girls in the Shinyanga region Tanzania since launching there in 2012.  UNFPA Tanzania  15 June 2016   SHINYANGA, United Republic of Tanzania  Unlike 95 per cent of girls her age in Tanzanias Shinyanga region, at 17, Rahuba Kenedy was enrolled in secondary school  and excelling academically. Then, she met a charming man and started dating him. However, in Tanzania only 34 per cent of sexually active, unmarried adolescent girls have access to modern forms of contraception, and soon, she became pregnant. As a result, she dropped out of school before graduation and married the man. He never paid the dowry he had promised her family, and soon took to leaving her and her children alone for weeks at a time without a single cent or food. Three years after their marriage, she had had enough and temporarily left her husband. After two months, she returned  only to discover that without warning her, he had remarried another adolescent girl. I was really hurt. I could not believe my husband could have done that to me, she says. That night I stayed with a neighbour, and the following morning I started a painful journey home [to my mothers] with my two daughters. And I made up my mind it was time for me to move on. And that is exactly what she did. One week after returning to her mothers village, a friend introduced Rahuba to a newly established community centre that hosted a programme called the Very Important Girls Group, supported through UNFPAs Action for Adolescent Girls initiative. Rahuba decided to join. It was a decision that would change her life.  Former President of Tanzania Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete (left) and UNFPA Exectutive Director, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, during the 6 June meeting at the UN in New York.  UNFPA/Koye Adeboye Investing in girls leads to economic growth In Tanzania, 64 per cent of the population is under age 25, perfectly situating the country to capitalize on a demographic dividend  a boost in economic productivity that occurs when there are growing numbers of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents. But gaining this economic growth will require investing in youths, and especially girls, health, education and ability to contribute to their communitys economy  including by ensuring they have access to sexual and reproductive health and family planning, so they can determine the timing and spacing of their children and reduce their number of dependents, if they so desire. We cannot afford to leave our young people behind, because they are not only our hope, but they are our future too, said former Tanzanian President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, during an address on sustainable development and the demographic dividend given at the United Nations headquarters in New York on 6 June. Investing in them is an opportunity that should not be missed at whatever cost.  But there are many challenges to ensuring that every girl in the country can realize her full potential. Girls who marry or become pregnant are much less likely to stay in school. And nationally, approximately39 per cent of Tanzanian girls have become pregnant by age 19, and 37 per cent have married. At 59 per cent, Shinyanga has Tanzanias highest rate of child marriage. My future is now UNFPA launched the Action for Adolescent Girls programme in the country in 2012, and it is currently operating groups for adolescent girls in four districts in the Shinyanga region, and reaching thousands more in the surrounding communities through outreach. Participating girls and young women learn about sexual and reproductive health and family planning, receive income generation training in areas, such as batik cloth dying and sewing, and become empowered voices in their communities able to contribute to growth and achieving a demographic dividend.  An adolescent girl performs sexual and reproductive health outreach.  UNFPA Tanzania Rahuba joined the Very Important Girls Group and never looked back. She quickly became one of its leaders and a peer educator. And now she runs her own batik business, allowing her to support her mother and daughters, and has joined a local football team and theatre troupe. She also works as a reporter for a weekly radio program, supported by Action for Adolescent Girls, that offers information about sexual and reproductive health, including the importance of postponing pregnancy and marriage, and about income generation skills for women and girls. I believe that if I had had this information early enough, I would not have fallen pregnant and would have continued with my education, she says of her outreach efforts. And parents, especially fathers, should support their children to stay in school instead of marrying them off. "

NA,"press","17 October 2015","Statement  A New Era in the Fight against Poverty 17 October 2015  AR EN FR ES  Statement of UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin on The International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, 17 October 2015. The International Day for the Eradication of Poverty has special significance this year. Last month, the world community adopted an ambitious, universal agenda that will guide development over the next 15 years. The Sustainable Development Goals, which are at the heart of Agenda 2030, represent an entirely new level of ambition. Most notably, countries have committed to eradicating extreme poverty altogether. To lift people out of poverty, countries will need stronger and better social protection systems. But to sustainably eradicate poverty, they will need to create many more jobs. By 2030  the target year of the new development agenda  we will need to create 469 million new jobs. Approximately 40 per cent of these jobs need to be created in the worlds least developed countries, which currently account for only 1 per cent of global economic output. Many young people entering the labour force in these countries are unable to find productive, paid employment. A majority find their first job in the informal economy  which captures an estimated 70 per cent of all employment in some countries. An estimated 35 per cent are living on less than one US dollar a day, according to the International Labour Organization. Eradicating poverty will require sound economic policies that create decent jobs and ensure social protection, coupled with improvements in the human capital of young people to strengthen their employability. An essential, but often neglected aspect of the development of human capital is the realization of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights for all. Too many young girls are married off as child brides, too many become mothers as teenagers, too many suffer from violence and discrimination, too many drop out of school and too many are denied equal participation in the social, economic and political life of their countries. The eradication of extreme poverty is inextricably linked to a healthy transition to adulthood for everyone, characterized by the protection of their human rights, including their reproductive rights, and a fair chance to pursue their dreams and live up to their potential. Sexual and reproductive health care, including family planning and contraceptive services, enables women and adolescent girls to protect their health and choose the number, timing and spacing of their children. This empowers them to study, work and raise their families out of poverty. The empowerment, education and employment of young people, particularly adolescent girls, is essential in order for them to be able to capitalize on their own potential, enrich their communities and help unleash a demographic dividend for their countries. UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, remains committed to supporting the poorest and most vulnerable, empowering women and girls, facilitating the development of young people, and helping countries realize a demographic dividend. That is how we will end poverty and ensure that no one is left behind."

In countries with large youth populations, young people who are educated, empowered and employed can boost development. Growing up healthy and educated, and free from dangers such as child marriage, young people tend to have fewer children and are able to earn, save and invest more money in themselves and the economy. This boost in growth is known as a demographic dividend, and can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by the year 2030. However, such a dividend is only possible where health, education, decent work and the right policies are in place.

For the majority of young people living in LDCs, opportunities to fulfil their potential and contribute to a better world have expanded in the past 20 years, but they remain curtailed by countless barriers. This report profiles these populations by studying their age structure, geographic distribution and well-being across a range of factors essential for realizing a demographic dividend. While significant gains have been made in primary education and child health, wide gaps remain between girls and boys, and poor and rich, and barriers grow as children become adolescents and youth, setting the stage for long-term costs. The report follows young people from childhood into adolescence and adulthood, as they pursue education, empowerment and employment and seek to improve their lives and the lives of those around them. Finally, it explores the rapid demographic, social, economic and environmental changes LDCs face, including insecurity, crises and disruptions that threaten tenuous recent gains.

NA,"press","29 June 2005","    Press Release  UNFPA Reaffirms Advantages of Investing in Reproductive Health 29 June 2005   UNITED NATIONS, New York If modern contraceptive services were available to all 201 million women with unmet need in the developing world, 1.5 million women and children would be saved each year, and the number of unplanned births would be reduced by 72 per cent, according to a new publication by UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund. Fewer unintended pregnancies means healthier women and babies, and fewer maternal and infant deaths.  Reducing Poverty and Achieving the Millennium Development Goals: Arguments for Investing in Reproductive Health & Rights outlines future dividends of investing in reproductive health. These dividends would be reflected in healthier, more productive individuals and families, which would contribute to stronger, wealthier nations. The publication was released at United Nations Headquarters today during a Roundtable on Health featuring senior representatives of various governments and United Nations agencies. Among the many benefits of reproductive health are improving family and community well being, boosting economic gains, saving womens and childrens lives, and greatly curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS  benefits that go a long way in helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Poor reproductive health, says the report, accounts for a sizeable proportion of the world's total burden of disease and disability  as high as 1/3 among all women, and 1/5 of the total global burden, including men and women. Almost half of the world's six billion people are under the age of 25, and the largest group of adolescents is entering its reproductive years and the workforce. How these young people fare will have lasting consequences for countries' future development. Todays investments in adolescents' health and development, says the publication, will consolidate the gains from initial investments in child survival and primary education. In addition to the many physical and psychological benefits of investing in sexual and reproductive health, the publication highlights the economic returns that go beyond the health sectorincluding public expenditures on education, housing infrastructure, food, and other social services. Every US dollar invested in family planning, for example, has saved more than $16 in Thailand and $31 in Egypt. Access to family planning leads to lower levels of mortality and fertility. This creates a larger body of young people with the ability to be active in the workforce, leading to a ""demographic window"" that yields powerful macroeconomic benefits. With a greater proportion of potential workers relative to dependents, ""a country has the opportunity to boost economic growth through higher short- and medium-term savings and investment,"" says the publication. The demographic window could reduce poverty in developing countries by about 14 per cent between 2000 and 2015. The publication also presents a list of practical ways to invest in reproductive health. The list was included in the ""Stockholm Call to Action,"" which was endorsed by a number of ministers, parliamentarians and leaders of multilateral agencies, civil society and youth organizations earlier this year. The document calls for investments to empower women to participate fully in development, to promote and build more equitable health systems, to link HIV/AIDS efforts with reproductive health, and to support young peoples health and development. The document also underscores the interdependence among development, security and human rights. * * * UNFPA is the world's largest multilateral source of population assistance.

They also asserted that safeguarding and promoting these needs and rights is essential to addressing barriers to the regions economic and social development and to delivering sustainable transformation for the continents future. The Addis Ababa Declaration came at the conclusion of the Ministerial Segment of the African Regional Conference on Population and Development, Harnessing the Demographic Dividend: The Future We Want for Africa, attended by ministers representing 52 countries, which was held here from 30 September to 4 October. The event was co-organized by UNECA, UN Economic Council for Africa, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, and the African Union as part of a UN mandated global review of progress towards the goals set out at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), intended to lead to a new agenda that puts human rights at the heart of development The declaration sets out a shared platform for action to address gender inequality, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights and to prioritize the education, empowerment and economic and social participation of women and young people. After days of intense discussions, informed by preparatory meetings of technical experts, civil society and youth organizations from across the region, delegates adopted the declaration which will be the regions input to next years UN General Assembly review of the ICPD. This will, in turn, inform global consultations on development priorities succeeding the Millennium Development Goals. The declaration will be incorporated into the work plans of the Africa Union and UNECA. The Declaration reasserts key principles of the ICPD Programme of Action, stressing States responsibility to protect human rights and to address the root causes of poverty, including taking action to prevent early marriage and to provide comprehensive sexuality education. It calls for universal and equitable access to sexual and reproductive health, including the eradication of female genital mutilation/cutting, universal access to family planning as a means to address maternal death and to prevent the spread of sexuality transmitted diseases, including HIV. The challenges and opportunities presented by Africas large and growing youth population are addressed with recommendations on the need for quality education, including comprehensive sexuality education, decent work and rights-based policies that effectively respond to urbanization and migration. Creating conditions for peace and security, including addressing violence towards women and girls, was acknowledged as fundamental to inclusive sustainable social and economic development and harnessing the demographic dividend for Africa. At the closing, Carlos Lopes, United Nations Under-Secretary-General, commended governments for their forward-looking agreement. The Addis Ababa Declaration on Population and Development speaks for itself by making a strong stance to ensure the dignity and equality. It calls for new partnerships to reaffirm the continuous relevance and importance of population and related issues as key to development strategies. I also note that most of these commitments are focused on the youth, and on implementation of pro-youth policies, said Mr. Lopes. Governments adopted the Declaration by consensus. Several governments recorded reservations in relation to certain paragraphs of the declaration. Closing the conference, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, Executive Director of UNFPA, said: The opportunity Africa has today to reinvent, develop and become more competitive is standing right in front of us. They are our young people, unleashing their potential will require specifically focused investment in youth. I am pleased that Africa has come up with its own set of priorities that can be taken forward into the post 2015 development and African 2063 agenda.

To achieve genuine development, we must transform our approach with and for young people, and in particular young women and girls. Young people are drivers of change. They must have the choices and tools to fully participate in development, realize their potential, and contribute to their societies, said Dr. Osotimehin, adding that universal access to rights-based sexual and reproductive health, including contraception, is a key step to empowering young people. Speaking at the International Conference on Family Planning, in Addis Ababa, the UNFPA Executive Director highlighted barriers to the full realization of young peoples rights. Adolescents are subjected to our double standards, and for girls in particular, the consequences are grave: They are not old enough to drive, yet old enough to be a parent? They are not old enough to vote, yet old enough to be married? Old enough to be pregnant, yet not old enough to have full access to sexuality education or contraceptives? Let us be clear: There can be no room for motherhood in childhood and we cannot continue to deprive young people of their rights to sexual and reproductive health, he said. Dr. Osotimehin paid tribute to civil society, technical experts and government representatives who are working to achieve significant progress in family planning. Today, countries with the highest unmet need for family planning are at the forefront of global efforts to expand access to contraceptive information, services and supplies, according to a new report released in Addis Ababa this week. Also at the conference, five governmentsBenin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Mauritania and Myanmarannounced major new pledges for family planning. The momentum behind this acceleration towards universal access to sexual and reproductive health, including maternal health, is rightly putting family planning at the heart of our combined efforts, said Dr. Osotimehin. We congratulate governments and communities that have stepped up to the challenge, here in Africa and elsewhereespecially to the extent that this is protecting and enforcing human rightsand UNFPA is proud of our partnerships that are affirming and accelerating these achievements. UNFPA has helped countries develop policies and programmes to ensure availability of sexual and reproductive health information and services, realize gender equality, and expand capabilities that young people require for employment, health, resilience, participation and citizenship. UNFPA is also assisting countries in harnessing the benefits of the demographic dividend the economic prosperity that can emerge when there is reduction in fertility rates coupled with strategic investments in health, education and job creation for young people. Together we are creating the conditions for the realization of the demographic dividend by investing in equitable and high-quality access to rights-based reproductive health and reproductive rights. This will then allow girls to stay in school, to decide if and when they want to marry or have children, and will allow them to develop the skills and capabilities to be active as leaders, said Dr. Osotimehin. By empowering this generation, he added, we will be able to bridge the world into a better future.

NA,"press","10 April 2023","Press Release  UN calls for urgent action to address education crisis as global primary school-age population peaks In 2023 10 April 2023   New York, 10 April 2023  The global population of primary-school-aged children is expected to reach an all-time high of 820 million in 2023. The number of secondary school children is also on the rise, but the education sector, shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic, is struggling to meet the rising demand. Against this challenging backdrop, the United Nations Commission on Population and Development convenes this week, from 10 to 14 April, to discuss the vital impact that investing in quality education has on promoting opportunity and prosperity, advancing gender equality and ensuring environmental sustainability. School closures and teaching disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic have worsened existing inequalities in access to and quality of education, said Mr. Li Junhua, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. Low-income and lower-middle-income countries face extraordinary challenges in recovering from the resulting learning losses and in resuming progress towards the universal completion of primary and secondary education by 2030. These challenges are felt most sharply in sub-Saharan Africa, where the primary-school-aged population is projected to increase by 86 million between 2022 and 2050 and where education systems were hard- hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary schools in the region can only accommodate 36 per cent of qualifying students. These trends require significant investments in education and skills training in the coming years. Investing in quality education today is essential to transform lives, economies and societies tomorrow, stressed Dr Natalia Kanem, Executive Director of UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency. Education is game-changing, especially for girls. When girls can finish their schooling, avoid early marriage and childbearing, and make a safe, healthy transition to adulthood, they can chart their own path and contribute to a healthier, more equitable and prosperous future for themselves and their communities. Deliberations at the Commission on Population and Development will inform the High-level Political Forum in July, as well as the upcoming SDG Summit to be convened by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2023. Five focus areas of this years Commission on Population and Development The adverse impacts of COVID-19 on education The COVID-19 pandemic exposed deep-seated flaws in education systems and highlighted pre-existing inequalities in access to education. Enrolment shortfalls were compounded by profound deficiencies in infrastructure, digital access, modern teaching methods and qualified teachers. Low-income and lower- middle-income countries experienced significant cuts in public spending on education making it all the more difficult to recover from learning losses. Digital inclusion: key to reducing inequalities Digital inclusion is a necessity of modern life. The pandemic also brought digital inequalities to the fore. In 2021, some 90 per cent of the population in developed countries used the Internet, compared with only 27 per cent in the least developed countries. The digital divide is especially pronounced for women and girls. Globally, women are 21 per cent less likely to be online compared with men, rising to half as likely in the least developed countries. Education: key to realizing the demographic dividend and empowering women Education is a key determinant of development. It is among the most powerful predictors of both economic productivity and income growth as well as population health and well-being. Evidence suggests that a substantial portion of the demographic dividend (a boost in per capita economic growth derived from an increase in the relative size of the working-age population during a particular stage of the demographic transition) may in fact be an education dividend. The education of women and girls contributes significantly to the health and survival of children and the eradication of child marriage, early childbearing and unplanned pregnancy. Combined with family planning services, the expansion of primary and secondary education has afforded women greater autonomy in reproductive decision- making. Education also increases womens access to jobs in the formal sector, reduces vulnerable employment and lowers gender wage inequality. Sexuality education: key to empowering young people Sexuality education is a crucial and cost-effective means to protect the health and rights of people at all stages of their lives. Well-designed curricula to deliver comprehensive education on sexuality, gender, relationships and rights in participatory, learner centred, age-appropriate and culturally relevant ways can help to foster positive social norms, promote gender equality and reduce gender-based violence. Lifelong learning: key to sustained, inclusive economic growth Globally, over 770 million adults, most of whom are women, are illiterate. Moreover, with unprecedented numbers of people living longer, lifelong learning and the re-skilling of workers are more important than ever. Nevertheless, in nearly half of all countries, lifelong learning accounts for less than 2 per cent of education budgets. Empowering workers of all ages can lower the burden on health and pension systems and support inclusive economic growth.  ********** Find out more about the 56th session of the Commission on Population and Development and follow the plenary session via UN Web TV.

NA,"press","01 October 2015","Statement  Sustainable Cities for All Ages 01 October 2015  AR EN FR ES  Statement byDr. Babatunde Osotimehin, Executive Director, UNFPA, on the occasion of theInternational Day of Older Persons. Population ageing and urbanization are major global issues of the 21st century. While cities are growing, their share of residents aged 60 years and over is also rising. Rapid urbanization is challenging both national and local governments in developing inclusive and integrated cities. Today, as we observe the International Day of Older Persons, we must ensure that cities respond to the needs of persons of all ages and that older persons are as much a part of urban life as their younger counterparts. This years theme of Sustainability and Age Inclusiveness in the Urban Environment fits in perfectly with the objectives of the recently adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: leave no one behind! Together, we must ensure that older persons are fully integrated in cities economic, social, political and cultural life. What can we do to make our cities more inclusive? We can start by ensuring that both younger and older generations are included in the urban planning process and their issues, needs and concerns are equally taken into account. We need an approach to urban planning that focuses on well-being throughout the life cycle. We should invest in young people today by promoting healthy habits, ensuring education and jobs, and providing access to health services and social security coverage for all workers. This is the best investment to improve the lives of young people, help stem the increasing tide of out-migration, and improve the lives of future generations of older persons. At the same time, we must provide affordable and accessible health-care services, lifelong learning and retraining opportunities, and flexible employment for older persons to improve their well-being and facilitate their integration into the fabric of communities. Strengthening human capital by ensuring empowerment, education and employment of all citizens will yield a high return on investment and will help countries reap a demographic dividend that can lift millions out of poverty. Creating hope and opportunity for young people to develop their full potential can drive progress in the years to come and, ultimately, result in a second demographic dividend of healthier, wealthier and more productive older persons. Today, we call on policymakers and urban planners to work together to ensure an inclusive urban environment for all ages. This means paying particular attention to the important pillars of urban living, such as housing, transportation, basic social services, and health care, to make them age-friendly. It means creating an ageless society, characterized by an urban physical environment that facilitates personal mobility, safety and security. It means creating an urban social environment that encourages respect, social inclusion, and participation. And it means protecting natural resources, preparing for natural disasters, and reducing risk so that current and future generations look forward to a sustainable future.Today, we call on urban leaders to ensure the protection of the human rights of all urban residents, including the elderly who are more vulnerable, and to enforce zero tolerance of discrimination, neglect, violence and abuse of older persons. Ensuring sustainability and age inclusiveness in the urban environment means creating a society for all ages where the voices of all generations are heard and where the needs of both young and old are met. It means empowering young and old to fully participate in the economic, social and political life of their communities. It means gathering data on city residents and their needs and working to ensure that they are adequately met. It also means sharing experiences about what makes a city a great place to live in for both young and old. Age-friendly cities are not just elderly-friendly. They are better for everyone."
NA,"resources","2014","        Resources  Population and poverty   Resource date: 2014  Author: UNFPA         Population trends and dynamics can have an enormous effect on prospects for poverty reduction and sustainable development. Poverty is influenced by  and influences  population dynamics, including population growth, age structure, and rural-urban distribution. All of this has a critical impact on a countrys development prospects and prospects for raising living standards for the poor. Investments in better health, including reproductive health, are essential for individual security and for reducing mortality and morbidity, which in turn improve a countrys productivity and development prospects. Reproductive health and poverty reduction Access to sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, can affect population dynamics through voluntary fertility reduction and reductions in infant and maternal mortality. Improved reproductive health also helps individuals, particularly young women, break out of intergenerational cycles of poverty.When women and couples are empowered to plan whether and when to have children, women are better enabled to complete their education; womens autonomy within their households is increased; and their earning power is improved. This strengthens their economic security and well-being and that of their families. Cumulatively, this contributes to development progress and poverty reduction. In addition to improving general health and well-being, analysisshows that meeting the reproductive health and contraceptive needs of all women in the developing world more than pays for itself. For every dollar invested in contraception, the cost of pregnancy-related care is reduced by $1.43. The lifetime opportunity cost related to adolescent pregnancy  a measure of the annual income a young mother misses out on over her lifetime  ranges from 1 per cent of annual gross domestic product in a large country such as China to 30 per cent of annual gross domestic product in a small economy such as Uganda. If adolescent girls in Brazil and India were able to wait until their early twenties to have children, the increased economic productivity would equal more than $3.5 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively. The power of young people A countrys economic growth is often shaped by overarching demographic trends. Developing countries with large youth populations and declining fertility rates could see their economies soar, provided they invest heavily in young peoples education and health and protect their rights, according to The State of World Population 2014. Potential economic gains could be realized through a 'demographic dividend,' which can occur when a countrys working age population grows larger relative to dependent populations, the report shows. Family planning is important an important part of this process because many countries have large youth populations that will almost ensure continued rapid poulation growth unless fertility declines, which is what offers the possibility of the demographic dividend. Where rapid population growth far outpaces economic development, countries will have a difficult time investing in the human capital needed to secure the well-being of its people and to stimulate further economic growth. This issue is especially acute for the least developed countries, many of which are facing a doubling, or even a tripling of their populations by 2050.  A doubling of the population in the least developed countries means that between now and 2050 the working-age population will increase by about 15 million persons per year, on average, and that the labor force will increase by 33 thousand persons per day. Every day over this period about 33,000 young men and women will enter the labor force and will be looking for productive and remunerative employment that allows them to escape poverty, stay out of poverty, or simply live a better life than their parents did. In the least developed countries, about 80 per cent of the work force is unemployed, underemployed or are only vulnerably employed. The extent to which they can contribute economically will have huge impacts on their countries futures, as well as on their own lives. Human capital critically depends on investment in education beyond the primary level, but even more fundamentally it begins with investment in health, including sexual and reproductive health. This is particularly true when considering entry points to unleash the economic potential of women and girls.

NA,"news","16 July 2014","News  How to address low fertility fears? Invest in young people   Maryana Borisova, a young Roma activist from Bulgaria, attending a conference in 2013. Ms. Borisova demonstrates how investment in young people can generate gains for society. Credit: UNFPA   16 July 2014    PRAGUE, Czech Republic  When Maryana Borisova was a teenager in Bulgaria, she seemed destined to follow the same life path as other girls in her traditional Roma community: She would get married and have her first child long before turning 18, then drop out of school and, with few job prospects, she would take care of the household and family.  Instead, she became the first-ever university graduate in her extended family. She then went on to become a lawyer and a human rights advocate. Ms. Borisova attended a recent conference in Prague, where experts and policymakers from Eastern Europe and Central Asia gathered to discuss solutions to the regions population challenges. Among the issues under discussion was building human capital  the knowledge and abilities that make people productive in their communities. Ms. Borisovas unlikely path illustrates the power of increasing young peoples human capital.  UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador Catarina Furtado (centre) speaks at a conference in Pragu on building the human capital of young people. Photo credit: UNFPA She managed to convince her father that girls education matters, though many relatives remained sceptical. In the end, he was the best father to think about the future of [his] daughter and not about what the community would say, she said. Highly educated, economically independent and empowered to shape her own life, Ms. Borisova is now contributing to her countrys development. For many young people, however, such opportunities remain a distant dream. In my country, 50 per cent of Roma are young, and most of them are uneducated and unemployed, she said at the conference. The solution: young people It is increasingly apparent that investing in people like Ms. Borisova is the solution to a thorny demographic problem: Many see the stubbornly low fertility rates and ageing populations in Eastern Europe as an impending crisis, one that will place huge burdens on social systems. Policies focusing narrowly on increasing birth rates have largely failed, said Heimo Laakkonen, UNFPAs Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and studies show that there is little chance fertility rates will grow significantly in the near future. Low fertility is now a global phenomenon, and expectations to get fertility rates back up above replacement level are quite unrealistic, said Tomas Sobotka, one of Europes leading demographers, referring to the average number of 2.1 children per women that is widely seen as necessary to maintain the size of a population. This means that population ageing will continue at a fast pace. But experts say there is little to worry about  provided governments make the right policy choices and invest in young people. As Mehmet Ceylan, Trkiye's Deputy Minister of Development, said: ""Ageing is inevitable, but it is manageable."" Return on investment In what Nikolai Botev, the director of UNFPAs sub-regional office in Central Asia, called a major paradigm shift, policymakers in Eastern Europe and Central Asia are increasingly looking to build the human capital of their populations, rather than pursuing population targets. But by investing in the health and education of people, governments can expect huge returns, because a better educated and healthier workforce will increase productivity, nurture innovation and decrease burdens on social systems. Countries can also expect to see returns from increasing gender equality and reducing discrimination. A 2010 World Bank study calculated that in Bulgaria, for example, the expected fiscal gain from providing one Roma child with an education is eight times higher than what the state spends on education per pupil. The inclusion of all Bulgarian Roma in the workforce could lead to productivity gains of 526 million euros annually, or 1.8 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product. Other age groups also require attention. With an ageing population, we need to extend employment opportunities for older people through lifelong education, said Natalya Fedorovych, Ukraines Deputy Minister of Social Policy. Window of opportunity closing fast There is a window of opportunity in which to make these investments, Mr. Laakkonen said. Countries in the region could realize a demographic dividend  economic gains that can occur when fertility rates fall and working-age populations grow  if they act now. Demographic dividends have helped catapult a number of countries, mostly in East Asia, out of extreme poverty. But governments must act fast and decisively. The window is closing quickly, by approximately 2030 in the case of Eastern Europe, as populations are ageing rapidly, Mr. Laakkonen added. Even for countries with struggling economies, investing in human capital will never be more affordable than it is now.        Ms. Borisova also insisted that disadvantaged populations not be overlooked. Discrimination makes it difficult for even the most educated young Roma to find jobs, she said. Her own career path has already led to concrete changes. Emboldened by her example, more than 10 other young women from her community have managed to attend university in recent years, she said. Now all of us have better chances in life, despite all the obstacles, Ms. Borisova said, and more opportunities to realize our potential.  Jens-Hagen Eschenbaecher    "

NA,"news","22 November 2019","News  In the Sahel, where motherhood is deadliest, midwives are saving lives   The first woman to give birth at Fatoumata Diallo's clinic named her daughter after the midwife.  Vincent Tremeau/World Bank  22 November 2019   SEBOUGOU, Mali  One day while driving on a highway, Fatoumata Diallo picked up a pregnant woman walking home from a prenatal checkup more than 10 kilometers away, a very long distance for any woman in her state to go on foot. It was not the first time she had witnessed these challenges in her home village of Sebougou in Mali. ""I grew up here and saw the difficulties that women and children have,"" said Ms. Diallo. The bus that connects the village to nearby towns doesn't run after dark, and Sebougou's only health clinic lacks basic equipment and staff. Babies are often delivered by nursing assistants. When Ms. Diallo heard about a new midwife training course offered by the Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) project, she didn't hesitate to apply. Soon after completing the training, Ms. Diallo decided to open her own private practice, and is now able to save lives. ""Giving birth to a child is a great feeling,"" she said. ""When a woman gives birth and she and the child are well, it's a moment of great, great joy."" SWEDD data from Mali show that in 2016 there were 2,657 midwives and obstetric nurses in the entire country  only 1.4 midwives for every 10,000 inhabitants. That ratio falls well below the standard of 23 doctors, nurses or midwives per 10,000 people recommended by the World Health Organization. In Mali, these services are particularly urgent because of the high number of vulnerable mothers and babies. According to a 2018 demographic survey, some 36 per cent of adolescent girls in Mali had already begun childbearing. Pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death among adolescent girls, and their newborns face higher rates of dangerous complications, as well. A full-service clinic In addition to basic care, Ms. Diallos practice offers prenatal and postnatal care and delivers babies, services that have helped reduce maternal and infant mortality rates in the community. As in any modern hospital, every woman who enters the clinic gets her blood pressure and temperature checked. A doctor checks the shape of the abdomen and prescribes an ultrasound scan to confirm pregnancy. Ms. Diallo also talks to her patients about family planning  and procures whatever they may need. ""If a woman wants birth control, we present [her] with all the methods. We have intrauterine devices, condoms, cycle beads, tablets, the pill and injections,"" Ms. Diallo explained. ""[Then] it is up to the woman to think about it and decide which one she wants to use."" Access to modern family planning is scarce across most of the Sahel, where maternal and neonatal mortality rates are among the highest in the world. Pregnant women, especially in the region's rural areas, lack access to adequate delivery care services. The midwifery training courses are just one small part of what SWEDD offers. The region-wide initiative aims to raise the status of women and girls, improving their health, education prospects and future earning potential. The ultimate goal is to help the region achieve a so-called demographic dividend: with its young population, the Sahel has an opportunity to boost its own development and economic growth by empowering women and girls to fulfill their potential through education, family planning and other investments.   Happy patients The SWEDD project is financed by the World Bank and implemented by the governments of Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cte dIvoire, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, with technical support from UNFPA. In particular, UNFPA is supporting SWEDD efforts to provide pre-service training to build the capacities of midwifery training institutions and internship sites, and to develop and update the training curriculum. UNFPA is also helping train midwives by setting up and implementing a clinical mentorship programme in remote areas, and creating networks for emergency obstetric and newborn care in participating countries. So far, the SWEDD project has helped train over 6,600 midwives across the implementing countries. Ms. Diallo is delighted by the warm reception she has received from patients and the community since she opened her practice in 2016. The first woman to give birth at her clinic was so happy that she was able to walk there, that she named her daughter after Ms. Diallo. Aminata, this first babys mother, praised Ms. Diallo for the care she received. ""[Ms. Diallo] comes to help you when you need it. That's a sign of a good person,"" she said. She hopes that her daughter will become a midwife when she grows up. A version of this story was first published at www.worldbank.org."
NA,"press","18 November 2014","    Speech  Statement of the Executive Director on The State of World Population 2014 report 18 November 2014    Statement of UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin on The State of World Population 2014 report Check against delivery Welcome to the launch of The State of World Population 2014, The Power of 1.8 Billion: Adolescents, Youth and the Transformation of the Future. Never before have there been so many young people. Never again is there likely to be such potential for economic and social progress. How we meet the needs and aspirations of young people and enable them to enjoy their rights will define our common future. Let me give you an example of just how powerful and transformative young people could be if countries invested in them in ways that yielded a demographic dividend. East Asia invested in its young peoples human capital starting in the 1960s, enabling the region to realize its demographic dividend, contributing to a six percentage point surge in GDP and a quadrupling of per capita incomes in some countries. If sub-Saharan Africa drew on East Asias experience, adapted it to the local context and made comparable investments in young people, the region could experience an economic miracle of its own, adding as much as $500 billion its economies every year for as many as 30 years. Today, nine in 10 of the worlds 1.8 billion young people live in less developed countries, where the young encounter obstacles to their rightsto education, to health, to live free from violence. Many of these young people may never realize their full potential, as leaders, as change-agents, as entrepreneurs, as people with the power to transform the future. A staggering 57 million young people are out of school. One in seven new HIV infections occurs among adolescents aged 10 to 19 years. More than one in three women, including those who are young, suffer violence from an intimate partner. Every minute, 27 girls are forced into marriage and expected to have a child while they themselves are still children. And let me emphasize this: A world in which a quarter of humanity is without full enjoyment of their rights is a world without the basic building blocks for change and progress. And even when a young person makes a safe and healthy transition from childhood to adulthood, the transition to the workforce may be blockedby scarce opportunities, by stagnant economies or other policies that keep decent jobs in short supply. An estimated 120 million young people enter the labour force every year. The UNFPA report shows that young people today already account for two in five of the worlds unemployed. On the road to realizing their potential, more and more young people today are running up against a wall of inequality, discrimination and exclusion. And we know that young women and adolescent girls face more obstacles than young men and boys in building their capabilities, seizing opportunities and enjoying their rights. And those who are poor, rural or members of an ethnic minority are especially vulnerable to the denial of rights and exclusion from social and economic opportunities. The State of World Population makes the case for urgent investment in young people so they may be engaged in their communities and the development of their nations. It also means tearing down barriers to their accessing key services, especially sexual and reproductive health care and information. Without these essential services, young people cannot protect themselves from HIV, cannot prevent a pregnancy, cannot have control over their own bodies. With the right investments, young people can unleash their power to build a better future. In fact, the UNFPA report shows that the returns on investments in young peopleparticularly young women and adolescent girlscan be enormous, with the potential to catapult developing economies forward and eliminate extreme poverty, which is a central objective of the next generation of development goals to succeed the Millennium Development Goals in 2015. UNFPAs State of World Population report shows that with the right support to reach their full potential, young people can become a formidable force for productivity, innovation and creative dynamism to accelerate development.

Between 2015 and 2030, the target date for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the number of older persons worldwide is set to increase by 56 per centfrom 901 million to more than 1.4 billion. By 2030, the number of people aged 60 and above will exceed that of people aged 15 to 24. UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, raises awareness about demographic shifts towards older populations and about the need to harness the opportunities and address the challenges of population ageing. UNFPA also supports research and data collection to provide a solid base for policies and planning, and makes sure ageing issues are integrated into national development programmes and poverty reduction strategies. The theme of this years International Day of Older Persons is Stepping into the Future: Tapping the Talents, Contributions and Participation of Older Persons in Society. As we step towards the better future we all want, leaving no one behind will mean making space for the contributions of older persons. Let us promote the rights and ensure the full participation of older persons to build better societies for all ages.   "
NA,"resources","2015","Resources  UNFPA & the Sustainable Development Goals   Resource date: 2015                On 25 September, the 193 member states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, a set of 17 goals aiming to transform the world over the next 15 years. These goals are designed to eliminate poverty, discrimination, abuse and preventable deaths, address environmental destruction, and usher in an era of development for all people, everywhere. The Sustainable Development Goals are ambitious, and they will require enormous efforts across countries, continents, industries and disciplines  but they are achievable. UNFPA is working with governments, partners and other UN agencies to directly tackle many of these goals  in particular Goal 3 on health, Goal 4 on education and Goal 5 on gender equality  and contributes in a variety of ways to achieving many of the rest.* Click on the icons above to see how UNFPA's work will help advance this bold vision for a better, healthier, more equitable and more sustainable future. To see a full list of the Goals, visit United Nations 2015: Time for Global Action.  Nicolas Axelrod/Ruom for UNFPA1 NO POVERTY Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere One in five peoplein developing countries live on less than $1.25 a day. Millions of others live on only slightly more, and are at risk of slipping back into extreme poverty. Poor health and lack of access to education both result from poverty and help perpetuate it. Conflicts and disasters also contribute to these dire circumstances, undermining social and economic stability. UNFPA works with governments, other UN agencies and partners to improve access to sexual and reproductive health care in developing countries, where reproductive health problems are aleading cause of ill health and deathfor women and girls of childbearing age. Reproductive health care  which includes maternal health services and family planning enables women to protect their health and choose the number, timing and spacing of their children. This empowers them to study, work, and raise their families out of poverty. UNFPA also works to eliminate harmful practices like child marriage, which keep girls from school, and advocates for young peoples access to health care, skills development and jobs. Healthy, educated, employed and empowered young people improve not only their own prospects but the prospects of their community as well. Nations may realize a demographic dividend  a boost in economic productivity  when there are growing numbers of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents. UNFPA also responds to the reproductive health needs of people caught in emergencies. Together, these measures help some of the world's most vulnerable people realize their rights, maintain their health, seek opportunities and reach their full potential.

End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture The effects of hunger do not go away after a meal is served. Chronic poor nutrition has lasting effects, and can even extend into the next generation. Pregnant women who are nutritionally depleted may face complications in pregnancy, and can pass the ill-effects of hunger onto their future children. UNFPA trains and supports midwives, health workers and health systems that address the nutritional needs of pregnant women and girls. At antenatal visits, which are often a woman's first introduction to the health system, expectant mothers receiving counselling on proper nutrition. UNFPA-supported waiting homes also serve nutritious meals to pregnant women while they await delivery.

Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages This goal calls for achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health care, reducing global maternal death rates, and ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Reproductive health problems are a leading cause of ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in developing countries. Impoverished women suffer disproportionately from unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion, maternal death and disability, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and related problems. Young people are also extremely vulnerable, facing disproportionately high HIV rates as well as barriers to reproductive health information and care. UNFPA is the lead UN agency in promoting sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, comprehensive sexuality education and maternal health services. UNFPA works with partners to strengthen health systems, including through the training of midwives, who  when properly trained  could avert two thirds of maternal and neonatal deaths. UNFPA also supports the integration of HIV-prevention and treatment programmes into sexual and reproductive health care, so it is as readily available as possible.

Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning Some 103 million young people around the world lack basic literacy skills; more than 60 per cent of them are women. Additionally, research shows that a majority of young people lack sufficient knowledge about their sexual and reproductive health, leaving them vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancy and a host of other concerns. UNFPA works with governments to promote gender equality as well as investments in education and opportunities for young people. UNFPA also supports programmes that teach literacy, numeracy, human rights and life skills to vulnerable adolescent girls, and helps to develop and implement comprehensive sexuality education, which teaches young people about their bodies, health and disease prevention. Equipping women and girls with the ability to choose the timing and number of their children also helps them stay in school. See more: Sexuality education comes to Kyrgyzstan, Universal quality education impossible without upholding girls and young peoples rights,In Niger, empowering girls to take a stand against child marriage    UNFPA Guatemala5 GENDER EQUALITY Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Women are much more likely than men to be impoverished, deprived of education and opportunities, and victimized by sexual and domestic violence. Goal 5 calls for the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls, the end of all forms of gender-based discrimination, and the elimination of harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM). It also calls for ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. UNFPA supports policies and programmes that promote gender equality at all levels  from villages and schools to whole countries. UNFPA also collaborates with partners around the world to eliminate child marriage and FGM, practices that violate girls rights and perpetuate inequalities. And UNFPA works closely with partners  including men and boys themselves  to fight the global epidemic of gender-based violence. UNFPA leads the UNs efforts in promoting access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including through strengthening health systems, training midwives, improving education about sexual and reproductive health, and supporting health services in many of the most deprived places on earth.

Ensure access to water and sanitation for all Each year, millions of people die  and many more are sickened  from diseases associated with poor water, sanitation and hygiene. These needs can be especially acute in emergencies, where the specific hygiene needs of women and girls are often overlooked. UNFPA distributes 'dignity kits' in disaster- and conflict-affected communities. These kits contain menstrual pads, soap, underwear, and other essential supplies to help women and girls maintain their health, hygiene and sense of dignity, even under grave circumstances.

Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all Around the world, young people are struggling under a lack of decent work opportunities and insufficient investments. Yet the potential of this generation of youth is unprecedented: There are more young people in the world than ever before. Coupled with declining fertility rates in many parts of the world, many developing countries have a rare opportunity to recognize a demographic dividend  a boost in economic productivity that occurs when there are growing numbers of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents.. But to make the most of this opportunity, countries must encourage decent employment, invest in education, and ensure access to adequate nutrition and health services, including sexual and reproductive health care. UNFPA is working with partners, including civil society, communities and governments, to encourage policies that can help countries realize a demographic dividend. See more: Youth empowerment, education, employment key to future development, School campaign aims to help Cte dIvoire reap demographic dividend    UNFPA Indonesia/Sandra Siagian10 Reduced inequalities Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries Economic growth will not be sufcient to reduce poverty if it is not inclusive. Yet by some measures, inequality is growing, and there remain large disparities in peoples access to health and education services. UNFPA works to reach marginalized people and communities, especially those who have been left behind by economic growth and development. This includes vulnerable women and girls, those living with disabilities and indigenous communities. UNFPAs efforts include extending health services to those out of reach, supporting programmes that promote gender equality, advocating for an end to gender-based discrimination and violence, and addressing the needs of vulnerable migrants.

Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable More than half the global population lives in cities, and the numbers of urban residents are only growing. Cities offer the promise of education, jobs, and health and social services, yet too many people are unable to access these benefits. Many urban residents live in slums and contend with extreme poverty and exclusion. UNFPA works with partners to promote inclusive urbanization, including by improving access to health care and opportunities in urban slums. UNFPA also advocates for the welfare and sustainability of urbanizing communities, and helps gather data about their needs.

Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Climate change affects every country in the world  from extreme weather events and changing weather patterns to the rising sea level and disrupted national economies. These effects will only grow worse with time. Urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to mitigate and adapt to climate change's impacts. UNFPA is working with governments to better understand how population dynamics affect the changing climate and how people can become resilience in the face of these changes. With partners, UNFPA has developed Demographic Exploration for Climate Adaptation (DECA), which helps policymakers see where vulnerable populations are and what hazards they might face. This information can form the basis of policies for planning more sustainable infrastructure and reducing disaster risks. UNFPA also helps address the humanitarian consequences of climate change. See more: UNFPA programme to help turn climate information into action   UNFPA/Pilirani Semu-Banda16 Peace, Justice And Strong Institutions Goal 16. Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies Justice and the rule of law are essential for development. Yet for too many people, justice is out of reach. This is especially true in emergency situations, where peoples vulnerability to violence  including sexual violence  increases. UNFPA helps to strengthen policies and services for survivors of violence. For instance, UNFPA works with police and judges in many countries to strengthen services for survivors of gender-based violence and to improve womens and girls access to justice.

Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society. These partnerships must be built on a shared vision and understanding of the world. Goal 17 calls for increasing the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data. UNFPA plays a key role in supporting censuses, demographic and health surveys, and other large-scale data-gathering exercises, and provides technical support for the analysis and dissemination of the information generated.

NA,"news","03 October 2019","News  Real men respect women, says school for husbands in Burkina Faso   The school for husbands and future husbands teaches men to empower their wives through behavior change. Here, men practice domestic skills to ease the burden on their wives.  UNFPA/Ollivier Girard  03 October 2019   MAMBOUE, Burkina Faso  Waimbabie Gnoumou is learning to be a better husband, says his wife, Martine. Thats because he is going to a special school that teaches men exactly that. The Husbands and Future Husbands School in Mambou, a village in western Burkina Faso, breaks down gender stereotypes and shows men the role they have to play in ending violence and empowering their wives and daughters. Ever since he started going to the husbands school, our relationship has improved significantly, Martine said. Husbands schools are not new. UNFPA has supported such schools since 2008, starting in Niger. Through these programmes, local facilitators teach men in their communities about the health needs and human rights of women and girls. The lessons are tailored to fit the customs and culture of the community. The lessons are wide-ranging  they include the importance of girls education, the need for pregnant women to receive antenatal care and safe delivery services, and the right of women and girls to live free of violence  but the objective is simple: to help men better understand the challenges facing the women in their homes and communities.       Reaching communities with the greatest needs These lessons are critical in the Sahel region of Africa, which has some of the worlds highest rates of preventable maternal death and some of the lowest indicators of girls empowerment. In Burkina Faso, 52 per cent of girls are married by age 18. Girls are less likely than boys to be enrolled in school, and when they are married they are less likely to use a modern form of contraception. The husbandsschools are one small part of a region-wide initiative, Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend project (SWEDD), which aims to raise the status of women and girls, improving their health, education prospects and future earning potential. The ultimate goal is to help the region achieve a so-called demographic dividend  a boost in development and economic growth that comes from empowering young generations to fulfil their potential, often through education, family planning and other investments. Behavioural changes at the male level have had positive impacts at the community level. The challenge for SWEDD is now to move from behavioural change to social norm change, Issa Sadou, a gender programme officer working for UNFPA in Niger. Men learn to challenge stereotypes and end violence. ""It was a chance to make a change in my life,"" said Mr.Gnoumou.  UNFPA/Ollivier GirardThe SWEDD project is financed by the World Bank and implemented by the governments of Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cte dIvoire, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, with technical support from UNFPA. In addition to the husbandsschools, the project offers vocational trainings for girls as well as initiatives to help girls stay in school, and advocate for their own health and rights. Rekindling a spark Every week, the husbands school in Mambou brings together about 16 men to learn about topics including family planning and household life. Two project facilitators work with the men to help dispel stereotypes and myths, such as the belief that modern family planning causes sterility. Mr. Gnoumou regularly attends these discussions, and takes pride in having changed his behaviour. I would often fight with my wife and even hit her, he reflected recently. When you hit someone, you are aware that what you have done is not right. More than 1,640 husbands schools have been established in countries implementing the SWEDD programme. UNFPA/Ollivier GirardToday, he offers a lot more help around the home, Martine says. He fetches water and wood, and does other household chores. And he hopes to inspire other men, as well. Everything we learn, we share with others when we get back to the village, he said. He wanted to be present for the birth of their last child  a first, Martine noted. Before, there was discord in my household, she said. Now, we dont have as many issues. Ever since he attended this training, we have rekindled the spark. Today, more than 1,640 husbands schools have been established in the countries where SWEDD is being implemented. A version of this story was first published at worldbank.org."
NA,"press","01 February 2017","    Speech  State of Executive Director to First Regular Session of Executive Board 2017 01 February 2017   Remarks of UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin to the 2017 First Regular Session of the Executive Board of UNDP, UNFPA and UNOPS. Mr. President,Distinguished Members of the Executive Board,Colleagues and friends,Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning! Let me begin by congratulating you, Ambassador Petersen, on your election as President of the Executive Board. I would also like to welcome the rest of the Bureau, Ambassador Laura Elena Flores Herrera of Panama, Ambassador Omar Annakou of Libya, Ms. Carolina Popovici of Moldova, and Mr. Talal Aljamali of Yemen. Let me also take this occasion to thank Ambassador Zohrab Mnatsakanyan of Armenia and the outgoing Bureau for their partnership, guidance and support throughout 2016.I would also like to acknowledge and thank my dear colleague Helen Clark for her leadership and partnership during her tenure as UNDP Administrator. On behalf of all of us in UNFPA, I wish her much success, health and happiness in the years ahead. Mr. President,Last year, we began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. One year on, this ambitious vision for people, planet and prosperity remains a powerful aspiration. Its adoption not only pointed the way to a more just, equitable, inclusive world and a healthier planet; it also renewed our faith in multilateralism and offered hope that consensus and collective action could be galvanized for the common good. This remains the hope of all of us even today. UNFPA is working to respond to this vision and to the expectations defined by the 2030 Agenda and ICPD Beyond 2014. In partnership with our sister UN agencies, we are firmly committed to delivering as one as we work to support Member States in achieving their development goals, in line with the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) and the vision of our new Secretary-General, Antnio Guterres. We look forward to working closely with Secretary-General Guterres and welcome his pledge to work for the promotion and protection of womens rights and to advance gender equality, including within the UN. I remain encouraged by the support for these issues around the world and was privileged to participate in two conferences in recent months where womens rights and gender equality were front and centre  the World Assembly for Women in Tokyo in December, where I took part in a panel on womens wellbeing and stressed the centrality of sexual and reproductive health and rights to womens empowerment. I also traveled to Montevideo, Uruguay, in October for the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Conference on Women, where I made the case for greater investment in the health and rights of adolescent girls. It is important to stress that Montevideo was the site where we got the most progressive outcome in the ICPD beyond 2014 review process, and I think that vision continues to provide leadership on these issues as we go forward. Gender equality and womens empowerment will remain key priorities for UNFPA in our Strategic Plan for 2018-2021, so let me turn now to where we are in the strategic planning process. New Strategic Plan I would like to thank those Board members who attended our workshop in December and who have continuously engaged with us individually and collectively. I thank you for your helpful feedback and guidance, which we are incorporating into the new Strategic Plan. We are also incorporating feedback from UNFPA staff, from UN inter-agency strategic planning groups, and from widespread consultations with partners, including young people, humanitarian partners, faith- based groups, civil society and foundations, and academia. UNFPA co-initiated and is proactively contributing to the UN inter-agency strategic planning working group, currently focusing on key areas, including linking resources to results; alignment to the SDGs; results-based management; and gender mainstreaming. The new Strategic Plan will focus on delivering an interconnected set of transformative results in line with our mandate and informed by a robust evidence base. This includes quality corporate and programme evaluations such as the evaluation on UNFPA support to adolescents and youth, which will be presented at this session. And while I am on the subject of evaluation, let me take this opportunity to thank Andrea Cook, our current Director of Evaluation, for her work over the past three years. We wish her well in her new role as head of Evaluation at the World Food Programme. The updates to the Board during the briefing session this afternoon will include a detailed presentation on the progress made to date in the strategic planning process. We see the new Strategic Plan as a critical opportunity to strongly position UNFPA in the 2030 Agenda. As the first of three consecutive plans with a time horizon of 2030, this Plan will lay the foundation for UNFPAs contribution to achieving the global goals. It will help us deliver on our mandate in a more turbulent world with increased demands for family planning and sexual and reproductive health services, even as we face strong headwinds and our core contributions and resources may come under further pressure. UNFPA will remain firmly focused on the bulls eye  that is, achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health, realizing reproductive rights and reducing maternal mortality  to support Member States in achieving the ICPD targets under the 2030 Agenda. These efforts must respond to the global development, humanitarian and peacebuilding landscape. Adolescent girls will continue to be a key focus group under the adolescents and youth area of work. Building on our successes and lessons learned from 2014-17, the new Strategic Plan will chart the path ahead for delivering these transformative results and the world we envision for todays 10-year-old girls and all women and young people by 2030. To succeed in these efforts, we count on the political and financial support of Member States. Let me say, once again, how grateful we are for this support, which is helping promote and protect the health and rights of women, adolescent girls and young people, particularly the most vulnerable and those left furthest behind. Your support is ensuring that more people have access to voluntary family planning, that more women receive the maternal health care they need so that they and their babies survive and thrive, that young people are empowered to reach their full potential and that they have a voice in decisions that affect them. I would like take this opportunity to underline that UNFPA does not engage in any coercive activities or methods of any kind. In fact, the ICPD Programme of Action endorsed by Member States is very clear: Reproductive health-care programmes should provide the widest range of services without any form of coercion. All couples and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so.  Member States support to the ICPD agenda and UNFPA over the years has enabled so much progress: Maternal deaths worldwide have fallen by nearly half since 1990. More women and couples have access to modern contraception. More girls are in school. More women and young people are able to exercise their human rights. Let me give you an example of what we have been able to do with modern contraception. In East and Southern Africa more than 30 million women in the last few years have been able to access modern contraception. This is a first. And the Ouagadougou Partnership in West and Central Africa has reached its target of 1 million new acceptors of family planning ahead of time, and they have now set a new target, which implies that what we are doing is working. But the job is not done, and we need to do far more. But, with our agenda and mission increasingly under attack in parts of the world, we need an even stronger UNFPA, politically and financially  one that can continue to stand up and speak up for the forgotten, for the marginalized, for the ones often left behind! Now more than ever, the world needs a UNFPA that is financially and structurally fit for this purpose. Because without this vital support  both political and financial  there is a risk of losing ground on critical priorities like maternal health, which is imperative to leaving no one behind. And it is not only momentum that will be lost if funding for these vital activities is discontinued or cut, it is womens and girls lives. Around 8% of all maternal deaths are due to unsafe abortion. These are needless deaths  deaths that could be prevented by universal access to voluntary family planning that enables women and couples to freely decide the number and timing of their children. In 2015, contraceptives provided by UNFPA had the potential to prevent 12.3 million unintended pregnancies, 4.4 million abortions, and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of women and children. Your support is saving and changing lives. So again, on behalf of all of us at UNFPA and those we are privileged to serve, let me say thank you. Over the course of the past year, we have faced considerable challenges: ongoing funding constraints and an uncertain political environment; historic levels of displacement around the world and ever greater humanitarian needs; and continued pushback on sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, gender equality and other issues central to our mandate and the ICPD agenda. The international landscape for resources has shifted dramatically in the past year. And unfavourable exchange rates continue to take their toll on our overall income. This political and financial uncertainty looks likely to continue in the foreseeable future. But we are committed as UNFPA to continuing to do the best we can with the little we have to address these important issues. Member States generous and continued support, particularly to our regular resources, is essential to enable us to continue delivering life-saving services and assistance to the women and young people we serve. We thank those countries who significantly increased their contributions to our regular resources in 2016, namely France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden. We are also thankful for the generous contributions of other countries both from the North and South. We encourage all Member States to contribute as much as possible to our regular resources, which are key to sustainability and delivery on UNFPAs mandate and the 2030 Agenda. At the same time, we also recognize that more work is needed on our end to address the challenges we face and improve efficiency. As you know, last year we instituted a number of austerity measures to respond to the decrease in regular resource contributions from a number of donors, who had redirected development resources to tackle urgent domestic priorities. These austerity measures, which included lower country programme ceilings and cuts in the institutional budget and in the global and regional initiatives, continue. In addition, we have undertaken a cost-mapping exercise to identify additional potential savings, including related to travel and other costs. We have frozen certain vacancies and are exploring ways to further streamline our processes and free up staff capacity and resources as a longer-term solution. While our current business model remains relevant for the 2030 Agenda, the new Strategic Plan will make some adjustments primarily to address changes in the global and local environments, and to make it more suitable to country needs. We continue to expand our partnerships and our donor base and to identify and support opportunities for South-South and triangular cooperation. A new strategic partnership strategy will be adopted soon, aimed at strengthening our reach, brainpower collaboration and resource mobilization efforts with the private sector, academia, high net-worth individuals, philanthropy, and parliamentarians. In this precarious political and funding environment, resource mobilization and advocacy must be the business of each of us at UNFPA, and we are intensifying these activities at all levels of the organization. This goes hand-in-hand with our efforts to improve organizational effectiveness, efficiency and delivery, which will enable us to achieve even better results as a valuable, trusted development and humanitarian partner. Humanitarian response Mr. President,Every day, from Afghanistan to Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine and Yemen, UNFPA and partners are working to meet the needs of women, adolescent girls and young people in emergencies, responding to their priorities and ensuring their participation. We also continue to support a number of countries affected by the situation in Syria. In 2016, UNFPA reached 11.4 million people with essential services to address sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence in humanitarian settings in 55 countries. Reproductive health kits totaling $7 million were dispatched to meet emergency obstetric and newborn care needs and to provide prenatal and postnatal care, address clinical management of rape, provide contraceptive choice and prevent and treat sexually transmitted infections. These services can mean the difference between life and death, yet they are often neglected because of the way money is divvied up when it comes to humanitarian action. So we need our Board Members to also speak up about the needs of women, girls and young people when donations are made for humanitarian response. Mr. President,Ive said it before and I will say it again: If we want effective humanitarian action and hope for the future, we must embrace the full participation and priorities of young people. Following the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security and the World Humanitarian Summit, UNFPA has been coordinating the Compact for Young People in Humanitarian Action and facilitating, with the Peacebuilding Support Office, a Progress Study on Youth, Peace and Security. The study is, in our view, a uniquely strategic contribution to shaping the youth, peace and security agenda. And both initiatives capitalize on the potential and creativity of young people as contributors to building resilient, sustainable, peaceful societies. In hotspots around the world, and globally, we at UNFPA are leading efforts to ensure that the specific needs of women, girls and young people are not neglected.This critical work, bridging our development and humanitarian efforts, will continue and will be mainstreamed throughout the new Strategic Plan. Data Mr. President,I would like to turn now to a subject vital to the implementation, follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda  data. The SDGs have spawned new data programmes and initiatives, and new energy and commitment around a data revolution for development. Ensuring strong national data systems is a massive undertaking requiring the skills and expertise of a wide range of partners. UNFPA is one of many UN agencies engaged in this work, and we welcome the chance to advance this work together. We have a unique role in data systems, and that is in population data. Our commitment in the data arena is a commitment to core areas of our work on census and SRH data, complemented by partnerships within a range of data networks. Late last year, to take just one example, UNFPA and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) jointly organized a regional meeting on building national data systems capacity for integrating the ICPD agenda into SDG processes at regional and country level in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region. For more than 40 years our work in the population field has been anchored in our strong support to national censuses, and as countries commit to leaving no one behind, these data will be more important than ever. UNFPAs Special Event tomorrow on Data Systems within the Framework of the SDGs will offer a country perspective on challenges and opportunities with respect to strengthening national data systems. We hope you will join us for what promises to be an engaging discussion. Demographic Dividend Mr. President,I have just returned from the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, where the fruits of UNFPAs advocacy and engagement around the demographic dividend were abundantly evident. African Heads of State and Government have demonstrated their commitment by devoting 2017 to Harnessing the demographic dividend through investments in youth. They have pushed for the development of a comprehensive roadmap to guide the efforts of countries and regional economic communities. UNFPA is proud to have been part of these efforts. Let me say, this is not just about advocacy; its about the work we do with countries on the ground. Today, UNFPA is working with 28 countries on the continent to support them in incorporating the demographic dividend into national development planning. I would like to thank all UNFPA colleagues involved for their hard work and support, which was recognized by the newly elected AU Chair, President Alpha Cond of Guinea, in his acceptance speech. We remain committed to working closely with governments and other partners, including the African Union Commission, towards making this vision a reality. It was also very heartening to hear the new Secretary-General speak to this issue and to say that this is an area in which the UN must work with Africa. We hope that future generations will look back on this year as a turning point in Africas development trajectory. UNFPAs activities in the area of family planning are a linchpin of our efforts to help countries, not only in Africa but around the world, capture a demographic dividend. You cannot reap the dividend without a strong family planning programme. And I want to thank the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom for co-hosting with us a roundtable in Addis Ababa on taking family planning to the next level in Africa. Participants acknowledged that family planning is the basis for demographic dividend, so I think that we are going in the right direction. It was also clear that African Heads of State are committed to addressing early and forced marriage, which together with increasing access to family planning can reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, reduce obstetric fistula, and ensure a healthier population of young people. If we can also ensure that girls go to school and stay in school and are able to reach their full potential, then countries can move forward and the dividend becomes even more realistic. Our most recent State of World Population report shows that girls who reach adulthood with an education and their health and rights intact stand to triple their lifetime income. Higher incomes and greater productivity can help fuel progress for entire countries. As Ive said time and time again, our collective future depends on how we support 10-year-old girls today as they start their journey from adolescence to adulthood. When we get it right, the effects can be truly transformative  both for the individual girls and their societies. Last month, I visited northern Nigeria, where I saw first-hand the impact of UNFPAs work with adolescent girls. In Kaduna State, I met Fatima Yusuf, a 12-year-old girl participating in UNFPAs Adolescent Girl Initiative. The programme provides safe spaces for vulnerable girls, where they receive mentoring, literacy and life skills classes, comprehensive sexuality education and sexual and reproductive health services. Fatima spoke on behalf of the girls. In fluent English honed in the programmes literacy classes and with a confidence beyond her years, she talked about the power of education, about their dreams of becoming doctors, nurses, lawyers, teachers, journalists. Of becoming Executive Director of UNFPA, or UN Secretary-General, or the first female president of Nigeria! As girls from rural communities, we are glad that there are no limits to our aspirations for the future. We want the same for all girls no matter where they live, Fatima said. Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Board, Isnt that what we all want? For every girl everywhere to be able to go to and stay in school; to be free from child marriage, teenage pregnancy and violence; to know and be able to exercise her rights, including her right to sexual and reproductive health; to be able to realize her full potential and help us build a better world. I know thats what we all want. Thats what the 2030 Agenda is all about. And I know, together, we can make it happen. Thank you.   "
NA,"resources","2014","        Resources  Population dynamics and policies   Resource date: 2014  Author: UNFPA         Population trends and dynamics play a powerful role in development, and must therefore be factored into planning and policy decisions. Population size and structure impact a countrys economy as well as its ability to provide social protections and access to health care, education, housing, sanitation, water, food and energy. Because population dynamics vary widely  from countries trying to provide opportunities for enormous youth populations to those coping with low fertility and ageing  policies dealing with population issues must be tailored to their specific needs. However, it is essential that these policies be grounded in a fundamental respect for human rights. Population dynamics are the cumulative result of individual choices and opportunities  and UNFPA has learned that real progress results when these choices and opportunities are enlarged rather than restricted. It is essential that these policies be grounded in a fundamental respect for human rights.  This is especially true when dealing with the protection of the sexual and reproductive health and rights of all people, a sensitive area, and one with enormous implications for population dynamics. The International Conference on Population and Development, the Millennium Development Goals, and the upcoming post-2015 development agenda all call for unrestricted and universal access to sexual and reproductive health care, including voluntary family planning. Because women and girls bear children, sexual and reproductive health is also an integral element of gender equality, which is a proven driver of economic and social progress. International agreements also call for higher investment in education beyond the primary level, with special consideration for the women and girls who are often left behind. Together, these measures will improve the lives of all people, helping to reduce infant, child and maternal mortality, reducing unwanted and adolescent pregnancies, and curbing the spread of diseases including HIV. At the same time, these human rights-based policies will help countries address the range of their demographic concerns. For example, in countries with high fertility levels and an unmet need for contraception, universal access to sexual and reproductive health services can help women plan and space their pregnancies, with a cascade of positive impacts for individuals, communities and the country as a whole. Decreasing fertility, coupled with investments in young people, can help countries realize a demographic dividend, a driver of economic growth. Similarly, human rights-based policies can assist countries grappling with large migration flows or rapid urbanization. Well-managed migration  internal or externalcan have many benefits. Evidence suggests that efforts to limit urban population growth, for example by restricting internal migration, have had limited success, if any. Data collection, analysis Rights-based policies should be complemented by efforts to anticipate and plan for population changes. To this end, countries need to collect disaggregated population data on a regular basis and use this data for planning at the national, local, rural and urban levels. Demographic data, together with data on environmental conditions, is essential to developing effective policies on housing, infrastructure, utilities and urban planning. Together with data on social and economic conditions and vulnerabilities, population data can inform investments in social services such as health care and education. Without such data, countries cannot hope to understand or meet the needs of their ever-changing populations. What is UNFPAs role? Through censuses and surveys, UNFPA supports the collection demographic information around the world. Then, using evidence-based analysis, UNFPA engages in policy discussions at the global, regional and national levels. This engagement often takes place in the context of Population Situation Analyses, common country assessments and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework. UNFPA supports countries in their efforts to formulate people-centred development strategies, goals and targets that account for and address population dynamics.

UNITED NATIONS, New YorkWith thousands of experts gathering in Dakar, Senegal, this week for the largest family planning meeting of its kind, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, is calling on world leaders to invest in voluntary family planning, not only to save and improve the lives of women and children, but also to empower people, strengthen health systems and reduce poverty. Unmet need for voluntary family planning remains appallingly high, said Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, UNFPAs Executive Director and a keynote speaker at the historic event. Investing in voluntary family planning today will not only pay dividends now, but will also help historys largest generation of young people enjoy opportunities and forge a brighter future. Family planning will also save womens lives and enable them to space their pregnancies, so that they can seize educational and employment opportunities. This would empower and enable them to contribute even more to their communities and nations, added Dr. Osotimehin. This conference in Dakar is officially about family planning, said Dr. Osotimehin. But its also about a larger effort to improve womens and childrens health. Its about every woman, every child. It is about accelerating social and economic progress. And its about a new path to sustainable development. The International Conference on Family Planning, which started today, brings together more than 2,000 leading scientists, experts and policy makers to examine cutting edge research and programmes that help advance the health and wealth of families and nations worldwide. It also aims to boost efforts to ensure wider access to family planningparticularly for the more than 215 million women in developing countries who lack access to modern family planning. The four-day conference will feature more than 140 plenaries and sessions, 45 panels and 170 poster exhibitions that will share the latest research, proven strategies, and lessons learned in addressing the need for family planning worldwide. UNFPA is co-organizing a number of panels and side events, including a session on integrating family planning with other reproductive health care; another on new developments to measure unmet need in family planning; a third on male involvement in family planning; and a fourth on key elements of successful programmes that deliver family planning services through community health programmes. UNFPA is also taking an active part in a high-level ministerial meeting on realizing the demographic dividend for the wealth and health of nations. To meet the global demand for family planning, we must galvanize greater political and financial support. We must hold governments accountable for their commitments, and champion innovation and access  both in the global North and in the South, said Dr. Osotimehin. Commitments need to turn from words to action.

NA,"news","18 July 2017","News  Youth offer solutions to global problems, if leaders take action now   Edith Nambalirwa is reaching other youth with her entrepreneurial spirit and knowledge of sexual and reproductive health.  UNFPA ESARO/Corrie Butler  18 July 2017   MUBENDE, Uganda/UNITED NATIONS, New York  Today, the world faces daunting challenges, from persistent poverty to entrenched inequalities. Yet one key solution is just over the horizon, if countries and leaders take action now. In many poor, developing countries in Africa and South Asia, demographics are changing, with large numbers of young people entering working age and falling numbers of dependents. These are potential conditions for a so-called demographic dividend  economic growth that can occur when proportionally more people are working, which enables families to save and invest more money. On a large scale, these changes can lift whole communities out of poverty. But there can be no dividend if governments do not first invest in the health, education, employment and human rights of young people.  Young people at a vocational training centre learn about comprehensive sexuality education through the Youth Enterprise Model. UNFPA ESARO/Corrie Butler By tapping into the massive transformative capabilities of youth, entire nations stand to ramp up their prospects, said Peter Thomson, President of the United Nations General Assembly, at a high-level meeting on the issue yesterday at UN Headquarters in New York. We must invest more of our resources in the training of young people so they can serve as innovators, entrepreneurs and agents of change. Youth leaders at the event echoed Mr. Thomsons call to action. Let young people contribute with our skills, our education, our ideas and our active engagement, said Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-Generals Envoy on Youth. The solution: Empowered young people Efforts to empower, educate and employ young people can have a cascading effect on the rest of society. Edith Nambalirwa, a 20-year-old in the Ugandan town of Mubende, offers a powerful illustration of this. Struggle is common in her community, which faces severe poverty, high HIV rates,high incidence of teen pregnancy and low levels of school completion. Ms. Nambalirwa has experienced her share of difficulties. I lost my dad when I was young, and Ive faced so many challenges, she told UNFPA. But today, she has a robust hairdressing business, and she is a role model for other young people. This is because, three years ago, she participated in UNFPAs Youth Enterprise Model (YEM), a programme that teaches young people about protecting their health and starting small businesses.  Sexual and reproductive health information enables young people to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, helping them focus on their goals. YEM peer educators do community outreach in rural village in Mubende Province.  UNFPA ESARO/Corrie Butler Through vocational schools and community outreach sessions, YEM is giving youth information about financial literacy and sexual and reproductive health, including how to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections like HIV. Information is also disseminated over the radio and through an SMS toll-free hotline. Ms. Nambalirwa says the information enabled her to focus on growing her business. She recently relocated the salon to accommodate her expanding client base. And she has become a peer educator, sharing what she has learned with the young people who visit her business, even convincing one client with HIV to continue taking anti-retroviral medication. For the young girls, its easy because Im young and they are also young. They can talk to me and tell me their problems, Ms. Nambalirwa said. I want to be an example for youth. I want to help my Uganda, she added. If I cannot do it with money, let me do it with knowledge. Commitments, inclusion needed But the efforts of individuals are not enough. Government commitments are needed if countries are to harness the skills and ingenuity of their youth, emphasized the ministers, advocates and UN officials at yesterdays high-level event. And countries must not only improve education, health care and job opportunities. They must also address gender inequality to ensure all young people have the means to emerge from poverty.  Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-Generals Envoy on Youth, urged leaders to engage young people as partners in development.  UNFPA/Eddie Wright We want our government to be committed both internationally and nationally to the issues of girls and young people, said Nur Hidayati Handayani of the Youth Coalition for Sexual and Reproductive Rights. And young people themselves must have a say in the decisions affecting them. Let young people be active partners, not passive beneficiaries, Ms. Wickramanayake said."

UNFPA/Ollivier Girard EN  DAKAR, Senegal  UNFPA and the West African Health Organization will continue to provide technical support to programmes to advance womens empowerment and strengthen legal frameworks that promote womens rights to health and education in Africa's Sahel region after the World Bank approved $376 million in new funds for Phase II of the Sahel Women Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) project. SWEDD 2 will scale up activities currently underway in Chad, Cte dIvoire, Mali and Mauritania and expand into Cameroon and the Republic of Guinea. The authorization of SWEDD 2 is a game-changer in our efforts to empower women and improve the lives of girls and women in the Sahel. It will certainly accelerate a demographic transition, and fast-track transformative shift in the region. Our gratitude to The World Bank for the support to scale-up this project as we strive towards more successful interventions, said Mabingue Ngom, UNFPA Regional Director for West and Central Africa. Phase II of the project will continue to support activities that target adolescent girls and their surrounding communities to improve life skills and sexual and reproductive health knowledge among adolescents; keep girls in school, expand economic opportunity; and create an enabling environment for girls social and economic empowerment through the nexus of statutory, religious and customary laws and norms, including through the prevention and improved response to gender-based violence. It will also enhance last-mile delivery of essential medicines, including access to contraceptives at the community level, and strengthen the capacity for midwives to deliver services in rural areas to women and adolescent girls. SWEDD 2 will pay more attention to strengthening legal frameworks that promote women's rights to health and education through reinforcing legislation, boosting judicial capacity, and promoting knowledge and application of existing legislation in communities where harmful practices  such as child marriage or female genital mutilation  are highly prevalent. Phase I (2015-2019) of the project intervened in areas and territories struggling to deal with child marriage, adolescent pregnancies and girls' school dropouts. SWEDD 1 made significant progress on girls' education, adolescent fertility, family planning, maternal and child health, the child dependency ratio and raising of the age of marriage. Religious and traditional leaders promote community dialogue in support of girls' secondary education, women's social and economic empowerment, birth spacing; and against child marriage, early pregnancy and female genital mutilation. Boys and men are engaged through community-based interventions for women's empowerment. The project contributes to eliminating systemic bottlenecks in health service delivery and developing a policy agenda that places demography and gender at the centre of growth. The regional initiative encourages country ownership of development programmes, emphasizes faire-faire and relies on national expertise to figure out the best way to effectively implement each programme. UNFPA has been providing joint technical support with the West African Health Organization to SWEDD since 2015. In Phase II, the African Union will join the project as a new strategic partner."
NA,"press","27 May 2016","    Press Release  Investments in Young Peoples Human Capital needed to Lift Least Developed Countries Out of Poverty 27 May 2016   ANTALYA, Turkey  Young people can lift the worlds 48 least developed countries out of poverty, provided governments invest in the education, empowerment and employment of millions of people poised to enter the labour force, top officials from these countries agreed here yesterday. In a set of far-reaching recommendations issued on the eve of a gathering to assess recent progress in the least developed countries, ministers and government officials cited advances in reducing infant, child and maternal death. But entrenched gender inequality, low educational attainment and other factors continue to hamper growth. The investments required to realize the demographic dividend and ultimately achieve sustained, inclusive and equitable development, include investing in the capabilities, empowerment, health and rights of young people in least developed countries, stated the ministers in a declaration issued at the end of the meeting. For this to be achieved, institutional reform, domestic resource mobilization as well as systematic consultations involving private sector, non-governmental organizations, young people, other community leaders and the international community are required. Young people in the least developed countries are especially important for development. About one in every three people in these countries is between the ages of 10 and 24. Educated, empowered and employed young people have the potential to drive economic growth. Representatives from governments, the private sector, multilateral organizations, civil society and academia are meeting in Antalya, 27-29 May, for a High-Level Midterm Review of the Istanbul Programme of Action, a 10-year roadmap for the achieving progress in the least developed countries.

NA,"press","20 October 2016","Press Release  UNFPA State of World Population 2016 20 October 2016  EN FR ES AR RU  Investing in 10-year-old girls could yield huge demographic dividend, pump billions into national economies  Girls are less likely than boys to complete schooling and more likely to face forced marriage, child labour, female genital mutilation and other undermining practices. More than half of the worlds 60 million 10-year-old girls live in the 48 countries with the worst gender inequality. $21 billion a year dividend for developing countries can be unlocked if all 10-year-old girls complete secondary education. UNITED NATIONS, New YorkForced marriage, child labour, female genital mutilation and other practices undermining girls health and rights threaten the worlds ambitious development agenda, warns UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, in The State of World Population 2016, released today. Practices that harm girls and violate their human rights--starting at age 10--prevent them from realizing their full potential as adults and from contributing to the economic and social progress of their communities and nations. Without their contribution, the United Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and its accompanying 17 Sustainable Development Goals may never be achieved. Ten is a pivotal age for girls everywhere, as puberty approaches. In some parts of the world, a girl at this age enjoys limitless possibilities and begins making choices that will influence her education and, later, her work life. But in other parts, a girl who goes through puberty is suddenly seen as a commodity that may be bought, sold or traded, the UNFPA report shows. She may be forced to marry, pulled out of school and expected to start bearing children and begin a lifetime of servitude. Impeding a girls safe, healthy path through adolescence to a productive and autonomous adulthood is a violation of her rights, UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin says. But it also takes a toll on her community and nation. Whenever a girls potential goes unrealized, we all lose. The new development agenda, endorsed by world leaders in 2015, is the blueprint for countries social and economic progress for 15 years. It aims for equitable development that leaves no one behind. Removing the barriers that hold 10-year-old girls back today will increase the chances that the agenda will be a success, the report argues. The State of World Population report notes that of the 125 million 10-year-olds today, 60 million are girls who are systematically disadvantaged at the global level as they move through adolescence into adulthood. Girls are less likely than boys to complete formal schooling at the secondary and university levels, are more likely to be in poorer physical and mental health, and will find it harder to get paid jobs. The range of proven policy options available to governments has grown over the past decade. These include banning harmful practices, such as child marriage and providing cash transfers to parents of girls in poor households to help defray costs of schooling, and, thus keep girls in school longer. They also include providing life-skills training and age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education to girls approaching puberty. The challenge now, UNFPAs State of World Population report says, is to scale up these interventions to reach more girls, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, by age 10. How we invest in and support 10-year-old girls today will determine what our world will look like in 2030, Dr. Osotimehin says. With support from family, community and nation, and the full realization of her rights, a 10-year-old girl can thrive and help bring about the future we all want. Key statistics  Nine out of 10 10-year-old girls live in developing countries, and one in five lives in a least developed country: one in five is in India, and one in eight in China. Each year of education delivers an additional 11.7 per cent uplift in wages in later life for girls (compared with 9.6 per cent for men). Yet, 16 million girls between 6 and 11 will never start school, twice the number of boys. If all the 10-year-old girls who drop out of school or do not attend school in developing countries completed secondary education, they would trigger a $21 billion annual dividend. Ten per cent of 5-to-14 year-old girls do more than 28 hours of household chores per week, twice that of boys. Three in four girl labourers are unpaid. Every day, an estimated 47,700 girls are married before 18.

H.E. Madam Liu Yandong, Honorable Vice-Premier of the Peoples Republic of ChinaH.E. Ms. Puan Maharani, Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Culture of the Republic of IndonesiaH.E. Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono X, Governor of YogyakartaH.E. Dr. Li Bin, Minister of National Health and Population Commission of China and Chair of PPD BoardMr. Nofrijal, Principal Secretary of BKKBNDr. Joe Thomas, Executive Director, PPDExcellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, Selamat pagi! Good morning! I would like to begin by thanking the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and Partners in Population and Development for organizing this Inter-Ministerial Conference in collaboration with UNFPA. It is an honor for me to address you, as the newly appointed Executive Director of United Nations Population Fund. I follow Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, a giant of Africa who tirelessly championed the rights of women and youth to have healthy sexual and reproductive health. This is the second time that I address this august conference on population and development. I was present in Wuhan in 2004, 13 years ago, when we declared the relevance of the International Conference on Population and Development, 10 years after Cairo. It is fitting that we meet here in Indonesia, the birthplace of South-South Cooperation. It is a noble history dating back to 1955 when the first AsianAfrican Conference was held in Bandung. The countries taking part in this conference are important actors in the realm of South-South and Triangular Cooperation. And we welcome your valuable contributions to inter-country cooperation. I would specify the Government of Indonesia, which has been very active since the early 1980s in sharing its experiences among developing countries. To date, Im told around 5,500 officials from 94 countries have learned through exchanges about the countrys family planning programme, evidence of Indonesias commitment to facilitating global sustainable development in the era of the Sustainable Development Goals. I understand that Indonesia stands ready to continue its front-line support of South-South and Triangular Cooperation, inter-country cooperation, to build knowledge in social and economic development and good governance. As a middle-income country with a majority Muslim population, and given its relative successes in family planning, I hope Indonesia can also play a larger role in sharing its experiences with other members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to strengthen the role of Muslim religious leaders in family planning. Indonesia also has much experience to offer other countries at soon to be similar demographic stages, especially in Africa, around institutionalising the demographic dividend while laying the foundation for reaping the bonus across sectors. And I look forward to its playing a greater role in this area as well. UNFPA acknowledges Chinas and Indias leadership on South-South Cooperation. I want to emphasize the need to operationalize the Taicang commitment and the unique opportunity we have with the Beijing Call to Action. Both put the emphasis on the establishment of Centers of Excellence and cross fertilization. We are also glad to continue to work with Dr. Hu, a strong supporter of South-South Cooperation and a great friend of UNFPA in the field of family planning and population. For us at UNFPA, South-South and triangular cooperation is an increasingly important mode of engagement, particularly among a large number of Middle Income Countries, as recognized in our new strategic plan. Earlier this year, we launched a new corporate strategy on inter-country cooperation. It outlines the principles, opportunities and operational approaches for promoting SSTC to scale-up national capacity to achieve the ICPD Programme of Action and the Sustainable Development Goals. We are currently training staff and positioning selected country offices as knowledge hubs to facilitate the exchange of expertise, information and resources, matchmaking countries needs and the best relatable, applicable experiences. This work includes brokering dialogue between countries on strategies for harnessing the demographic dividend; on best practices for delivering sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning; and on addressing gender-based violence, child marriage and other issues at the heart of the ICPD and 2030 agendas. The UN was founded on the principle of dialogue for peace! We at UNFPA are convinced that only by working together, innovating for scale, building on our collective achievements and experience, our strengths and our partnerships, will we be able to achieve by 2030 our three ambitious, transformative people-centred goals: zero preventable maternal deaths, zero unmet demand for family planning, and zero violence and harmful practices against women and girls, most apt as we emphasize the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence in this period starting this weekend. Many of the 150+ countries where we work have already made investments and developed expertise in areas critical to advancing the ICPD agenda. Even the most economically disadvantaged and smallest countries, which are often viewed primarily as recipients of South-South Cooperation, have good practices to offer others. At UNFPA, we view our role as facilitators of that knowledge exchange. We also recognize the important role played by Partners in Population and Development in helping advance implementation of the ICPD agenda through South-South Cooperation. A truly global agenda demands a truly global approach. The 2030 Agenda and its broad, ambitious, universal goals will require resources far greater than any UN agency, government or development actor can provide on its own. This means working closely with a wide range of partners, especially member states, but also the private sector and civil society, to share and scale up solutions. UNFPA, with its strong country presence and partnerships and its extensive experience and expertise as a trusted knowledge broker, is uniquely placed to facilitate the spread of innovation in South-South cooperation. We imagine a world where the power of the SDGs generation, youth, 1.8 billion strong, the largest youth generation ever, will fulfill their aspiration, good health, good education, good employment, in an atmosphere of peace and justice, where girls decide to marry and space their children according to their choice. We remain firmly committed to continuing to support the exchange of know-how between countries in need and those with deployable expertise to realize the ICPD and 2030 agendas, achieve our transformative goals and ensure a life of dignity, health and wellbeing for all, including young people and future generations. In the words of the founding President Soekarno of Indonesia: Berikan aku sepuluh pemuda, maka akan kuguncangkan dunia. Give me ten youths, then we will shake the world! Terima kasih. Thank You.   "

This is the message we will be bringing to the third International Conference on Family Planning (ICFP 2013) in Addis Ababa next week. As political leaders, researchers, young people and advocates in the field of family planning and reproductive health come together in Ethiopia from 10-15 November to call attention to the wide-ranging benefits of helping people plan their families, UNFPA will underscore the importance of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, especially for young people and other vulnerable groups. More than 40 per cent of the worlds population is under age 25 and reproductive choices are the key to ensuring that this young generation will have a future. When a girl becomes pregnant, her present and future radically changerarely for the better. All too often, a girls education will end, and her job prospects evaporate, while her vulnerabilities to poverty, health problems, social exclusion and dependency multiply. Political commitment and support are necessary to ensure that the benefits of family planning can be extended to all those who need them.

Photo &copy; UNFPA/Etienne Franca   12 November 2013   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia  One of the largest gatherings in the area of sexual and reproductive health, the third International Conference on Family Planning opened today in Addis Ababa, calling attention to the wide-ranging benefits of family planning to make the world a better place for women, children and youth. We can translate womens rights into womens reality, said Hailemariam Desalegn, Ethiopian Prime Minister and current Chair of the African Union (AU), in his opening address. It is my strong belief that this conference will be enriched by our experience on the ground and will assist countries to improve access to family planning.  UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin addresses the opening of the third International Conference on Family Planning. Photo  UNFPA/Etienne Franca In his opening statement, UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin reminded the audience of the importance of young people to promote development and reap the benefits of the demographic dividend. It can only happen if we invest in education, and if young people can exercise their rights, said Dr. Osotimehin. However, for as long as we have child marriage, adolescent pregnancy, and violations of the rights of the girl-child, we wont get there. Some 7.2 million girls get pregnant every year  200,000 every day. We have to stop this. And we can do it, he added. Other key panellists highlighted the momentum that has been built in the area of family planning, the results achieved so far, and challenges ahead. The Family Planning Conference was preceded by a High-level Ministerial Meeting, which invited Ministers of Health from several countries to visit health posts and learn more about progress made in Ethiopia, especially the countrys flagship health extension programme. Health extension programme transforming remote areas of Ethiopia With 34,000 government-paid health workers deployed in rural areas to provide a package of primary health care services, the health extension programme has helped Ethiopia achieve health related development goals ahead of time. Through the programme, health workers engage with village leaders in local languages to raise awareness about health issues and encourage the population to come to health centres and use their services. These health workers are joined by three million women volunteer leaders that are mobilized across Ethiopia to bring social transformation to remote areas. Balanish Gamada is one of them. Head of the Womens Office in the Aleltu woreda  or local administrative division  in the Oromia region close to the capital, she is responsible for a population of 38,000. Ms. Gamada, 27, provides counselling and information to help increase the use of health services, including family planning, at the nearest health centre.   Charts on the wall of a local health centre - part of the health extension programme - show progress made in several areas related to reproductive health and family planning. Photo  UNFPA/Etienne Franca For Ms. Gamada and the main issue is that awareness about reproductive health issues is not equal. Cultural barriers pose challenges, especially since womens independence and empowerment are still regarded as something that goes against the custom, she explains. The volunteers play a pivotal role in reducing misconceptions about family planning and fighting the harmful traditional practices that prevent women from seeking health services. The small team is succeeding in promoting change. This year, the number of beneficiaries has increased despite challenges. Focus on Youth The conference is being attended by approximately 3,000 participants, many of them young people who participated in a series of pre-conferences focused on youth. During a pre-conference event held at the African Union, young delegates from 31 African countries focused on sexual and reproductive health and the importance of investing in youth to help countries reap the benefits of the demographic dividend. They also discussed developing a youth agenda for the continent, and how it could be integrated in the ICPD Beyond 2014 and post-2015 development priorities. Approximately 90 per cent of the global population of 1.8 billion young people aged 10 to 24 live in developing countries. Africa is one of the youngest continents in the world, with large groups particularly vulnerable to poor sexual and reproductive health. For example, births by adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 account for 16 per cent of all births in sub-Saharan Africa every year. Organized around four major themes  social change; enabling environment for youth mobilization; youth-friendly services; and comprehensive sexuality education  the pre-conference allowed the young delegates to develop recommendations, an outcome statement, and a plan of action.to move forward on these areas. The priorities highlighted in the final document include: the importance of access to comprehensive sexuality education for young people in and out of school; the need to adapt health services to meet the needs of young people; stronger participation of young people in decision-making processes, particularly on health issues. The Family Planning conference continues through 15 November to address the challenges and results achieved in the area of family planning, including successful practices, innovations and an enhanced focus on young people.

NA,"press","01 October 2016","    Statement  The Transformative Force of Population Ageing 01 October 2016   Statement of UNFPA Executive Director, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, on International Day of Older Persons, 1 October 2016 Population ageing  one of the most significant trends of the 21st century  represents both a cause for celebration and a challenge. To ensure that everyones well-being is enhanced through this demographic shift, more efforts are needed to minimize lifelong inequalities and improve the life conditions of older people. People aged 60 and older accounted for 12.3 per cent of global population in 2015, and by 2050, that number will rise to almost 22 per cent. Most of the projected growth of the older population is expected to take place in developing countries. Asia is home to more than half of the worlds 901 million older persons, with 508 million people aged 60 or over. Another 177 million older persons reside in Europe, 75 million in North America, 71 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 64 million in Africa and 6 million in Oceania. In some countries, population ageing may lead to a proportionately smaller labour force. But whether this occurs, and its impact on the economy, will depend on many uncertain factors, including measures to increase the retirement age, on migration, and, ultimately, on the productivity of both people and machines. Population ageing can potentially be a socially disruptive force, as social inequalities tend to be magnified in old age. For example, elderly men receive, on average, a 68 per cent higher income than women due to their longer formal employment and higher lifetime wages. This is particularly significant as the older population is predominantly female. We at UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, could not agree more with the theme of this years International Day of Older Persons  Take a Stand against Ageism. We believe that reducing lifelong inequalities and embracing the contributions of older people offer tremendous prospects for development. These efforts start in infancy, with safe deliveries, and continue with good childhood nutrition and excellent schools. They require ensuring that sexual and reproductive health and rights are universal, that gender equality is assured, that social protection and income security extend to all older persons, and that wealth is transferred to younger generations. Discrimination and ageism in the workplace may be a growing concern in countries where life expectancy and good health encourage older people to keep working, especially if youth unemployment is high. Societies may need to alter their expectations about the natural age of retirement, or the public and private roles of older persons, as they remain increasingly active. Ageing populations rely on various sources of financial support  from labour income and assets, to their families and public programmes. This means that ageing countries will need to foster intergenerational dialogue and put in place policies that promote mutual understanding, and empower young and old alike to support one another. UNFPA continues to help countries respond to the opportunities and challenges of population ageing by promoting policy dialogue and supporting training, research and data collection disaggregated by age and sex. We are currently reviewing 15 years of progress towards the implementation of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing and supporting the exchange of lessons learned for a healthy ageing world and to capitalize on the second demographic dividend of a more productive and prosperous older population. Population ageing is a transformative force in every country that will test the existing structures of our economies, households and societies. Let us work together to ensure that all people can age with dignity and enjoy a lifetime of contribution, integration and well-being.    "

Your Excellency, President Mahamadou Issoufou, of the Republic of NigerYour Excellency, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Chairperson of the African Union and President of the Arab Republic of EgyptExcellencies, Heads of State and Government,Distinguished First Ladies of AfricaYour Excellency Chairperson of the African Union CommissionDeputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Madam Amina MohammedExcellencies, Heads of African Regional InstitutionsMinisters and Members of the Diplomatic CorpsDistinguished GuestsAll Protocols observed, My sincere gratitude to President Mahamadou Issoufou of Niger for bringing us together his evening ahead of your Summit tomorrow. At the outset, allow me to congratulate African leaders on the launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)/Zone de Libre Echange. We, of the United Nations, ably led this evening by the Deputy Secretary General, my boss, a proud daughter of Africa, Saraaouina Amina Mohammed, join the African Union in celebrating this achievement which is highly significant, especially for the young people of this continent. This year we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and its landmark Programme of Action. It was on this continent, in Cairo, where 25 years ago, African leaders proudly joined with all 179 Member States to imagine a future in which every pregnancy is by choice, a future in which girls no longer face childbearing in their tender, immature years. Tonight, as we reflect on our collective journey since Cairo, the question is: What has changed for Africa? Considerable progress has been made across the continent, thanks to your leadership. African womens access to family planning has increased.  Over the last 25 years, skilled birth attendance by qualified midwives has also increased, cutting by half the risk of women dying in pregnancy or childbirth.  In West and Central Africa, for instance death in child birth has fallen by fully one third. These are concrete results of your own efforts to invest in human capital. This is also a concrete example of how AU Commission led initiatives such as the brilliant Campaign on Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa (CARMMA) can bring about change. And, you First Ladies have played an instrumental role. With your permission, may we applaud the First Ladies. Since Cairo ICPD in 1994, Africa has made equally important strides in many other areas like our fight against HIV/AIDS. Not completely there yet, but visibly the HIV landscape is definitely not what it used to be. Tonight, it is an opportunity for us to celebrate your leadership and achievements in delivering on the Cairo commitments. We, at the United Nations, are honored to be with you in this journey. Excellencies, distinguished guests, African leaders have put womens empowerment and investments in youth at the center of African priorities, dedicating 2017 to the theme: Harnessing the Demographic Dividend through Investments in Youth. This morning, we were extremely pleased to hear leaders of the Sahel celebrate the strong results achieved so far through the Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD), a home-grown, country led, country owned initiative, backed by the World Bank and other key partners. Tonight, we want to congratulate President Issoufou who initiated the SWEDD here in Niamey. Initiatives like SWEDD, and those engaging faith-based organizations, traditional and religious leaders show the power of partnerships that empower women and girls. These investments are saving lives, they are creating hope and they are transforming economies. They are also evidence of your strong commitment. Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, We have made strong progress in our journey towards the Africa We Want. However, there is unfinished business in Africa: One in five women cannot meet their family planning needs as they wish; One in three women are married by age 18; and One in three women are affected by sexual and gender based violence. The Africa that we want is an Africa with 3 Zeros: Zero unmet need for family planning; Zero preventable maternal deaths, and Zero violence and harmful practices against women and girls, including female genital mutilation and child marriage. UNFPA and the entire UN family is committed to continuing our support for the realization of the Africa We Want. That is why the Governments of Kenya and Denmark, together with UNFPA, will convene leaders and participants from all over the world, from 12 to 14 November for the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25. This Summit will mobilize the commitments so urgently needed to finally and fully implement the ICPD Programme of Action. On behalf of the co-conveners, please join us in Nairobi. Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Colleagues and Friends, Nairobi offers us an opportunity to make commitments that will accelerate the good progress observed so far and to ultimately finish the unfinished business of ICPD. As President Mandela once remarked The mark of great leaders is the ability to understand the context in which they are operating and act accordingly. It is fortunate for Africa that such leadership exists here today and is producing tangible results. When the African adolescent girl gets to fulfill her potential as is her due, there is ample evidence that the return to be reaped on that investment is at least 10 times and can be up to 120 times more. When the African adolescent girl gets to fulfill her potential, Africa too will prosper. Tonight, I want to thank you on behalf of that African girl child. Before I close, meeting with African girls this afternoon, they asked me to carry their message to their Heads of State. I made a promise to them that I would. They want you to help them stay in school They want you to end child marriage They want you to enable them to fulfill their dreams. Merci. Gracias. Thank you."
NA,"updates","26 Jul 2019","Updates  With the Republic of Korea and UNDP, fostering youth-led innovations in Rwanda 26 Jul 2019   The Tantine mobile phone app, developed by one of the winners of the first round of UNFPAs iAccelerator programme, delivers youth-friendly information on sexual and reproductive health, in an easily accessible and engaging format. We thought of using ICT as a bridge, said co-founder Sylvie Uhirwa, to reach young people who might otherwise have no other source of reliable information.  UNFPA Rwanda  A new partnership with the Republic of Korea and UNDP is giving a boost to UNFPAs work to support young innovators in Rwanda who are devising and launching ingenious new ways to deliver youth-friendly information on sexual and reproductive health and rights. With over $600,000 in new funding from the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), the partnership will expand the YouthConnekt Initiative in Rwanda over the next four years (2019-2022). The initiative focuses on increasing access to decent jobs for young people as well as promoting their sexual and reproductive health. UNDP and UNFPA will work with the Rwanda Ministry of Youth and the First Lady of Rwandas Imbuto Foundation, as well as two private sector institutions  Liquid Telecommunications and National Industrial Research and Development Agency  to scale up the initiative. The programme will not only focus on job creation, said Minister of Youth Rosemary Mbabazi at the May signing of the agreement, but also on other components like engaging youth in policymaking and civic education  as well as increasing the number of youth accessing health services and adopting healthy practices. This is why the ministry brought on board other partners like UNFPA, the Imbuto Foundation and UNDP. Nurturing young innovators The initiative extends financial support to the Innovation Accelerator (iAccelerator) programme, which UNFPA in Rwanda runs together with the Imbuto Foundation. The iAccelerator encourages young people to think critically and creatively about issues related to sexual and reproductive health  and supports young innovators and entrepreneurs in finding youth-led solutions to encourage their peers to use sexual and reproductive health services and adopt healthy lifestyles.       The iAccelerator debuted in Rwanda with a competition launched in December 2016, followed by a series of boot camps and outreach initiatives to equip and encourage young entrepreneurs to take advantage of the opportunity to propose their own projects. The four winners of the first competition were the mobile phone app Tantine; the comic Girl District; the TV show Tubiganire, which aims to stimulate communication about sexual and reproductive health within families; and Umbrella, a digital platform offering women information and tools on menstruation and pregnancy. Each received a grant, training and mentorship to bring their ideas to life. Making information accessible and relevant The mobile phone app and website Tantine, which teaches young people about sexual and reproductive health, is the brainchild of Sylvie Uhirwa and her twin brother Sylvain Muzungu Hirwa. They got the idea for the app when a public health programme at their university brought them to the Mahama refugee camp, home to over 50,000 young people among the Burundian refugees who live there. The siblings noticed the high rate of unintended pregnancies in the camp  where young people have little or no access to information about their sexual and reproductive health and rights.       In addition to developing the app and website, they established a centre equipped with wifi and tablets, so that young people would have a quiet space to use the resources. Today, over 2,000 people use the app, which was recently taken on by Google. Every week, over 10,000 people access sexual and reproductive health information on the mobile-friendly Tantine website. In addition, the co-founders run a mentorship programme for young people. Another Phase 1 winner, Girl District, is a series of comics that convey information about sexual and reproductive health in a format that engages young people. According to co-founder Dominique Uwase Alonga, the project was born out of the co-founders own experiences: We grew up believing that the more ignorant you are about SRH the purer you are, she said. And Im now realizing you need to know as much as possible to make the best decisions possible. So we had to first internalize that as a team, before we took it to the girls and boys. The co-founders strove to make their product accessible, engaging and relevant to the lives of young people just like them. We want to be real to the situations they face, said Ms. Alonga. We want to be able to talk to the girl who goes home to a stepfather that might be molesting her. We want to be relevant to the girl who has just started dating... or is two months into a relationship. We are not making decisions for them, but making decisions with them, she added. Girl District also runs a mentorship programme in schools to spread awareness of sexual and reproductive health  and to get young people accustomed to talking about it. Investing in young people to support Rwandas demographic dividend With the new support from KOICA, UNFPA and the Imbuto Foundation are launching the iAccelerators second phase in August 2019, inviting young people between the ages of 18 and 30 to submit innovative business ideas in response to the challenge of expanding access to quality sexual and reproductive health information and services for young people.  Partners assembled at the signing ceremony: Rosemary Mbabazi, Rwanda Minister of Youth, and Kim Eung-joong, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea (front, left to right), with Mark Bryan Schreiner, UNFPA Representative in Rwanda; Stephen Rodrigues, UNDP Representative in Rwanda; Lee Byung Hwa, KOICA Country Director; Kampeta Sayinzoga, Director General, National Industrial Research and Development Agency; and Alexi Kabeja, Managing Director, Liquid Telecommunications (standing, left to right).  UNFPA Rwanda We are excited about this growing partnership, said Mark Bryan Schreiner, UNFPA Representative in Rwanda. We commend KOICA for recognizing and investing in the iAccelerator. With this funding, we will be able to support the Government of Rwanda to reach more youth with innovative solutions together with our partner, the Imbuto Foundation. In the spirit of the renewed United Nations Youth Strategy, this One UN Joint Programme supports the delivery of Rwandas Vision 2050, putting young people at the centre of the country's development. Ultimately, said Minister Mbabazi, the programme aims to support young people in driving socio-economic transformation. She noted that the partnership and the new funding has come at the right moment, as the country strives to reduce unemployment among young people  investing in their livelihoods, education and health, so that Rwanda can reap its demographic dividend."

The new office, opened during an official ceremony today, will facilitate even closer cooperation on global population and development matters, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, population ageing and humanitarian response.  Collaboration between UNFPA and the Republic of Korea goes back to 1974 when UNFPA helped the government in the area of population policy and planning, including rights-based family planning, population surveys and using data for sustainable development. This is a very auspicious moment for UNFPA, as we mark our 50th year as the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, promoting rights and choices for all. UNFPA has long been proud of its special relationship with the Republic of Korea, and our new liaison office will strengthen this important partnership, said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. As a developing country in the 1970s, the Republic of Korea made crucial investments in health, family planning, education and womens empowerment, spurring a significant demographic dividend,"" added Dr. Kanem. ""Now, it is sharing its wealth of experience, resources and best practices to support developing countries in Asia-Pacific and globally. UNFPA looks forward to enhancing our engagement with the Republic of Korea on sexual and reproductive health, population ageing and other issues, and to contributing together to a world of health, rights and choices for all ages across the life cycle.

NA,"press","11 October 2019","Statement  GirlForce: Unscripted and unstoppable on the road to Nairobi and beyond! 11 October 2019   Statement by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem on the International Day of the Girl, 11 October Around the world, girls are challenging gender stereotypes and breaking free from the traditional roles that society has dictated for generations. More and more are saying no to child marriage and pushing for an end to the practice. They are advocating for their right to stay in school and to live free from violence and harm. They are calling for urgent climate action and working to build more just, equitable and sustainable societies. On this International Day of the Girl, lets stand with them. This means ensuring that they have the information and support they need to make a safe, healthy transition to adulthood. It means listening to their voices and respecting their rights and choices. When girls have age-appropriate knowledge about their bodies and relationships, they are better able to prevent pregnancy and protect themselves from sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. They can stay on track to complete their education and gain the skills they need to find and keep decent jobs and reach their full potential. This is life-changing for girls and game-changing for societies. Empowering girls in all spheres of their lives can help countries lay the foundation for prosperity and well-being and reap a demographic dividend of economic growth. These issues and more will be on the agenda of the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25, being co-convened in November by the Governments of Kenya and Denmark, together with UNFPA. At the Summit, governments, civil society, the private sector, community leaders, international institutions and others will make concrete commitments to achieve the goals set out by 179 governments at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, or ICPD. These goals include ensuring girls rights to education and health; eliminating child marriage, female genital mutilation and other harmful practices; and meeting the special needs of adolescents and youth for access to information and reproductive health care. At UNFPA, we believe in the power of girls to take control over their bodies, write their own script and shape their own lives. Our global strategy for adolescents and youth My Body, My Life, My Worldis our rallying cry as we march with them towards the Nairobi Summit. Next year, the world will also mark the 25th anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, another milestone on the path towards rights and choices for girls. Many of the promises that governments made to girls in Cairo and Beijing have yet to be fulfilled. By following through on our commitments, we will set the stage for girls to live the lives they dream and be the unstoppable force for progress we know that they are."

NA,"press","19 April 2023","Press Release  UNFPA report identifies rising population anxiety, urges radical rethink of how countries address changing demographics 19 April 2023  AR RU  New York, 19 April 2023  New data reveals population anxieties are widespread and governments are increasingly adopting policies aimed at raising, lowering or maintaining fertility rates. But efforts to influence fertility rates are very often ineffective and can erode womens rights, according to UNFPA's State of World Population report, released today.  The landmark report 8 Billion Lives, Infinite Possibilities: the case for rights and choices calls for a radical rethink of how population numbers are framed  urging politicians and media to abandon overblown narratives about population booms and busts. Instead of asking how fast people are reproducing, leaders should ask whether individuals, especially women, are able to freely make their own reproductive choices  a question whose answer, too often, is no. Womens bodies should not be held captive to population targets, says UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. To build thriving and inclusive societies, regardless of population size, we must radically rethink how we talk about and plan for population change. A staggering 44 per cent of partnered women and girls in 68 reporting countries do not have the right to make informed decisions about their bodies when it comes to having sex, using contraception and seeking health care; and an estimated 257 million women worldwide have an unmet need for safe, reliable contraception. History has shown that fertility policies designed to increase or lower birth rates are very often ineffective and can undermine womens rights. Many countries have rolled out programmes to engineer larger families by offering financial incentives and rewards to women and their partners, yet they continue to see birth rates below two children per woman. And efforts to slow population growth through forced sterilization and coercive contraception have grossly violated human rights. Family planning must not be used as a tool for achieving fertility targets; it is a tool for empowering individuals. Women should be able to choose if, when and how many children they would like to have, free from the coercion of pundits and officials. The report strongly recommends governments institute policies with gender equality and rights at their heart, such as parental leave programmes, child tax credits, policies that promote gender equality in the workplace, and universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. These offer a proven formula that will reap economic dividends and lead to resilient societies able to thrive no matter how populations change. Key Facts and Figures from the 2023 State of World Population: Twenty-four per cent of partnered women and girls are unable to say no to sex and 11 per cent are unable to make decisions specifically about contraception, according to data from 68 reporting countries. A survey of eight countries showed people who had been exposed to media or conversations about the worlds population were more likely to view the global population as being too high. Global demographics are changing rapidly: Two thirds of people are living in low fertility contexts, while eight countries will account for half the projected growth in global population by 2050 (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania), dramatically reordering the worlds ranking of most populous countries. Blaming fertility for climate change will not hold the greatest carbon emitters to account. Out of 8 billion people, around 5.5 billion do not make enough money, about $10 a day, to contribute significantly to carbon emissions. A recent UN study says greater gender parity in the labour force would do more to sustain economies in ageing, low-fertility societies than setting targets for women to have more children. Notes to editors The State of World Population report is UNFPAs annual flagship publication. Published yearly since 1978, it shines a light on emerging issues in the field of sexual and reproductive health and rights, bringing them into the mainstream and exploring the challenges and opportunities they present for international development. This years report includes contributions from two UN partners: the International Organization for Migration and the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. As the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA helps people obtain contraception and life-saving reproductive health services and information and empowers women and girls to make informed decisions about their bodies and lives.

When we put gender equality and rights at the heart of our population policies, we are stronger, more resilient, and better able to deal with the challenges resulting from rapidly changing populations. Chasing fertility targets and trying to influence womens reproductive decision-making will only end in failure. History has shown that such policies are rarely effective and undermine womens rights. Investing in people and their potential is the surest path to prosperity and peace."
NA,"sdg","decade of action page, no date","  On 25 September 2015, the 193 member states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, a set of 17 goals aiming to transform the world by 2030.The goalsour shared vision to end poverty, rescue the planet and build a peaceful worldare gaining global momentum. Today, with just 10 years left to achieve the Global Goals, an ambitious global effort is underway. UNFPA is working with governments, partners and other UN agencies to directly tackle many of these goals  in particular Goal 3 on health, Goal 4 on education and Goal 5 on gender equality  and contributes in a variety of ways to achieving many of the rest.* Click on the icons above to see how UNFPA's work will help advance this bold vision for a better, healthier, more equitable and more sustainable future. To see a full list of the Goals, visit United Nations 2015: Time for Global Action.  Nicolas Axelrod/Ruom for UNFPA1 NO POVERTY Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere More than 700 million people live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than$1.90 a day. Globally, there are 122 women, 25 to 34 years old, living in extreme poverty for every 100 men of the same age group. Poor health and lack of access to education both result from poverty and help perpetuate it. Conflicts and disasters also contribute to these dire circumstances, undermining social and economic stability. UNFPA works with governments, other UN agencies and partners to improve access to sexual and reproductive health care in developing countries, where reproductive health problems are aleading cause of ill health and deathfor women and girls of childbearing age. Reproductive health care  which includes maternal health services and family planning enables women to protect their health and choose the number, timing and spacing of their children. This empowers them to study, work, and raise their families out of poverty. UNFPA also works to eliminate harmful practices like child marriage, which keep girls from school, and advocates for young peoples access to health care, skills development and jobs. Healthy, educated, employed and empowered young people improve not only their own prospects but the prospects of their community as well. Nations may realize a demographic dividend  a boost in economic productivity  when there are growing numbers of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents. UNFPA also responds to the reproductive health needs of people caught in emergencies. Together, these measures help some of the world's most vulnerable people realize their rights, maintain their health, seek opportunities and reach their full potential.     UNFPA/Ollivier Girard2 ZERO HUNGER Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture The effects of hunger do notdisappear after a meal is served. Chronic poor nutrition has lasting effects, and can even extend into the next generation. Pregnant women who are nutritionally depleted may face complications in pregnancy, and can pass the ill-effects of hunger onto their future children. UNFPA trains and supports midwives, health workers and health systems that address the nutritional needs of pregnant women and girls. At antenatal visits, which are often a woman's first introduction to the health system, expectant mothers receiving counselling on proper nutrition. UNFPA-supported waiting homes also serve nutritious meals to pregnant women while they await delivery.    Nicolas Axelrod/Ruom for UNFPA3 GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages This goal calls for achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health care, reducing global maternal death rates, and ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Reproductive health problems are a leading cause of ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in developing countries. Impoverished women suffer disproportionately from unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion, maternal death and disability, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and related problems. Young people are also extremely vulnerable, facing disproportionately high HIV rates as well as barriers to reproductive health information and care. UNFPA is the lead UN agency in promoting sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, comprehensive sexuality education and maternal health services. UNFPA works with partners to strengthen health systems, including through the training of midwives, who  when properly trained  could avert two thirds of maternal and neonatal deaths. UNFPA also supports the integration of HIV-prevention and treatment programmes into sexual and reproductive health care, so it is as readily available as possible.    UNFPA Cote d'Ivoire4 QUALITY EDUCATION Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning The world has achieved equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have achieved that target at all levels of education. Additionally, research shows that a majority of young people lack sufficient knowledge about their sexual and reproductive health, leaving them vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancy and a host of other concerns. UNFPA works with governments to promote investments in education and opportunities for young people. UNFPA also supports programmes that teach literacy, numeracy, human rights and life skills to vulnerable adolescent girls, and helps to develop and implement comprehensive sexuality education, which teaches young people about their bodies, health and disease prevention. Equipping women and girls with the ability to choose the timing and number of their children also helps them stay in school.    UNFPA Guatemala5 GENDER EQUALITY Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Women are much more likely than men to be impoverished, deprived of education and opportunities, and victimized by sexual and domestic violence. Goal 5 calls for the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls, the end of all forms of gender-based discrimination, and the elimination of harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM). It also calls for ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. UNFPA supports policies and programmes that promote gender equality at all levels  from villages and schools to whole countries. UNFPA also collaborates with partners around the world to eliminate child marriage and FGM, practices that violate girls rights and perpetuate inequalities. And UNFPA works closely with partners  including men and boys themselves  to fight the global epidemic of gender-based violence. UNFPA leads the UNs efforts in promoting access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including through strengthening health systems, training midwives, improving education about sexual and reproductive health, and supporting health services in many of the most deprived places on earth.    UNFPA/Millat Horiria6 CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION Goal 6. Ensure access to water and sanitation for all Each year, hundreds of thousands of people die  and many more are sickened  from diseases associated with poor water, sanitation and hygiene. These needs can be especially acute in emergencies, where the specific hygiene needs of women and girls are often overlooked. UNFPA distributes 'dignity kits' in disaster- and conflict-affected communities. These kits contain menstrual pads, soap, underwear, and other essential supplies to help women and girls maintain their health, hygiene and sense of dignity, even under grave circumstances.    UNFPA Benin/Ollivier Girard8 DECENT work and economic growth Goal 8. Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all Around the world, young people are struggling under a lack of decent work opportunities and insufficient investments. Yet the potential of this generation of youth is unprecedented: There are more young people in the world than ever before. Coupled with declining fertility rates in many parts of the world, many developing countries have a rare opportunity to recognize a demographic dividend  a boost in economic productivity that occurs when there are growing numbers of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents.. But to make the most of this opportunity, countries must encourage decent employment, invest in education, and ensure access to adequate nutrition and health services, including sexual and reproductive health care. UNFPA is working with partners, including civil society, communities and governments, to encourage policies that can help countries realize a demographic dividend.    UNFPA Indonesia/Sandra Siagian10 Reduced inequalities Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries Economic growth will not be sufcient to reduce poverty if it is not inclusive. Yet globallyinequality has proved to be persistent. This includes not only economic inequality, but also large disparities in peoples access to health and education services. Women are more likely than men to live below 50 per cent of the median income, for instance. And women in rural areas are up to three times more likely to die while giving birth than women living in urban centers. UNFPA works to reach marginalized people and communities, especially those who have been left behind by economic growth and development. This includes vulnerable women and girls, those living with disabilities and indigenous communities. UNFPAs efforts include extending health services to those out of reach, supporting programmes that promote gender equality, advocating for an end to gender-based discrimination and violence, and addressing the needs of vulnerable migrants.    UN Photo/Kibae Park11 Sustainable Cities And Communities Goal 11. Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable Half the global population lives in cities, and the numbers of urban residents are only growing. Cities offer the promise of education, jobs, and health and social services, yet too many people are unable to access these benefits. Many urban residents live in slums and contend with extreme poverty and exclusion. UNFPA works with partners to promote inclusive urbanization, including by improving access to health care and opportunities in urban slums. UNFPA also advocates for the welfare and sustainability of urbanizing communities, and helps gather data about their needs.    UNFPA Pakistan/Stenly Sajow13 Climate Action Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Climate change affects every country in the world  from extreme weather events and changing weather patterns to the rising sea level and disrupted national economies. These effects will only grow worse with time. Urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to mitigate and adapt to climate change's impacts. UNFPA is working with governments to better understand how population dynamics affect the changing climate and how people can become resilience in the face of these changes. With partners, UNFPA has developed Demographic Exploration for Climate Adaptation (DECA), which helps policymakers see where vulnerable populations are and what hazards they might face. This information can form the basis of policies for planning more sustainable infrastructure and reducing disaster risks. UNFPA also helps address the humanitarian consequences of climate change.   UNFPA/Pilirani Semu-Banda16 Peace, Justice And Strong Institutions Goal 16. Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies Justice and the rule of law are essential for development, yet for too many people, justice is out of reach. Sexual violence continues to plague many countries around the world, with under-reporting and lack of data aggravating the problem. This is especially true in emergency situations, where peoples vulnerability to violence  including sexual violence  increases. UNFPA helps to strengthen policies and services for survivors of violence. For instance, UNFPA works with police and judges in many countries to strengthen services for survivors of gender-based violence and to improve womens and girls access to justice.    UNFPA/Lorenzo Tugnoli17 Partnerships For the Goals Goal 17. Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society. These partnerships must be built on a shared vision and understanding of the world. Goal 17 calls for increasing the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data. UNFPA partners with global actors around the world, including businesses, academic institutions, governments and local-level implementing organizations. Such partnerships have yielded more than 1,000 commitments to enact concrete change over the next decade, as well as billions of dollars dedicated to advancing these goals. UNFPA also plays a key role in supporting censuses, demographic and health surveys, and other large-scale data-gathering exercises, and provides technical support for the analysis and dissemination of the information generated.

NA,"press","15 October 2012","Opinion  Harnessing the Potential of Older People 15 October 2012   In this Opinion Piece, printed in the Huffington Post, Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin talks about the recently published report, Ageing in the Twenty-First Century: A Celebration and a Challenge. He characterizes the report as a 'welcome antidote to those who continue to see the fact that we are living longer just as a burden'. In every continent and almost every country, our population is growing older. Increasing life expectancy, thanks to improved diets, better sanitation, medical advances and greater prosperity, as well as falling birth rates are altering the age profile of our societies at a remarkable rate. By 2000, for the first time in history, there were more people sharing our planet over 60 than under five. Such is the pace of change that, by 2050, the older generation will out-number those under 15. It is in the most highly developed countries where these demographic changes started. But they are actually progressing fastest outside the richest nations. By 2050, the developing world will be home to eight out of ten of the world's older people . This unprecedented silent revolution will clearly be one of the greatest forces shaping our societies over the coming decades. Yet, there is little sign so far that all the right policies and actions needed have been put in place to respond successfully to these challenges and create a world in which all generations can flourish. It was to help identify what needs to happen that the UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, together with HelpAge International, produced a comprehensive report into the demographic changes under way. Our report -- ""Ageing in the Twenty-first Century: A Celebration and a Challenge"" -- draws not only on expert input from over 20 UN and international agencies and entities, but also the views of hundreds of older citizens from across the world. The report is a welcome antidote to those who continue to see the fact that we are living longer just as a burden. It highlights how the opportunities from this demographic shift are as endless as the contributions that a socially and economically active, secure and healthy ageing population can bring. It shows the important role that older people , with the talents, skills and life experience, are already playing. What was striking was the strong common desire of the older people who took part in our consultations to be active contributors to their economies and societies. But it also makes clear that there are very important challenges that need to be faced now. While progress has been made in many countries to provide the conditions where this longevity dividend can be reaped, much more needs to be done, particularly taking into account that the population of 60 and older will be growing very fast over the next decades. Disturbingly, we also found evidence that many older people lacked dignity and security, facing discrimination and worse. The problems can be greatest for women who make up the majority of older people and can often be marginalized in their societies. Our report says putting this right and harnessing the rich potential of older people requires new approaches -- and quickly -- to a whole range of issues including health care, employment and retirement, housing, transportation, leisure and inter-generational relations. This is a challenge for all countries but greatest for developing countries that are often the least prepared for the changes underway. In particular, the report found three areas where action is required. First, there is an urgent need to guarantee income security and access to essential health and social services for older people, including the increasing needs for long-term care. This requires a strong political commitment and planning now to implement the necessary reforms. Second, we must invest in health, education and employment for the young people today as the best way to improve the lives of future generations of older persons. But this must be combined with flexible employment, lifelong learning and retraining opportunities to enable and encourage current generations of older people to remain in the labour market. We cannot afford to discard or waste their experience and expertise. Finally, we must involve everyone including governments, employers, civil society, communities, families and older persons themselves to develop a new culture in which their contributions to their economies and societies are recognized and promoted. ""Ageing in the Twenty-first Century"" says the evidence is already available to help us overcome these and other challenges successfully. It shows, too, that the rewards from getting this right will far outweigh the costs. What is required is to build the consensus across society -- and across generations -- to put the policies and investments in place to deliver our ambition for a world in which everyone, old and young, can live an active, secure and rewarding life. After all, today's young people will be part of a population of over two billion older people by 2050. It is an irony that rising life expectancy, which is a great triumph of development, is too often forecast to have a negative impact on our societies. Our report shows that there is no reason for such a pessimistic view. But reaping the full potential of our aging world requires us to show courage, commitment and vision now.

NA,"press","13 April 2015","Speech  48th session of the Commission on Population and Development 13 April 2015   Opening statement of Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, UNFPA Executive Director,at the 48th session of the Commission on Population and Development Madam Chairperson, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning! Let me begin by saying how pleased I am to acknowledge the presence here of so many Government officials joining us from your capitals, representatives of civil society, including youth organizations, whose efforts are so pivotal in implementing the ICPD agenda, transforming lives and securing our environment for future generations. The bureau of this Commission, under the leadership of Ambassador Frankinet, has done a magnificent job in preparing this session and I would like to express our gratitude to them. Let me also thank Under-Secretary-General Wu for the partnership with UNFPA in supporting the work of this Commission. Madam Chairperson, Last year was a landmark for the ICPD, a time of reflection, of celebration, of reaffirmation and of firm resolve to do better. This Commission and world leaders at the Special Session in September affirmed the mandate of the ICPD Programme of Action and the actions for its follow up beyond 2014. They recognized that the ICPD's timeless principles and commitments are prerequisites for sustainable development that delivers for all. As we design a new post-2015 development agenda, this CPD, by integrating population issues into sustainable development, can turn that reaffirmation into reality. By ensuring that the inextricable link between human rights and development is firmly rooted in the new development paradigm, we can jumpstart achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and ensure that no one is left behind. By unleashing the power of people, enabling them to exercise their rights and catalyzing all people's contributions to collective sustainability, we can advance dramatically towards realizing the dignity and human rights of all. Investing in Young People for Sustainable Development Getting it right for young people will be critical. Investments in the rights and well-being of adolescents and youth, now and throughout their lives, will unleash a demographic dividend of inclusive, sustainable economic growth in many countries, as they see larger numbers of young working age people relative to children and older persons. In our interconnected and globalized world, this dividend will pay off for all. Realizing this potential requires a powerful commitment to health, and in particular to ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights throughout the life course. We need to empower young people, especially adolescent girls, to make informed decisions, have control over their bodies and stay healthy. We need to empower young women to delay fertility, prevent adolescent pregnancy, stay in school and find jobs that provide security and well-being. Empower, educate, employ! Women and girls must be free from the threats of maternal mortality, gender based violence and harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. And they must have the opportunity to decide on the number and timing of their children. As the ICPD Beyond 2014 review showed these interventions can have enormous development benefits. But it also showed that the wealthiest populations account for much of the progress we have seen. Those who are poor, living in rural areas or urban slums, those experiencing discrimination and marginalization, continue to be vulnerable to denial of rights and to exclusion from social and economic opportunities. To extend sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights to all and bring about the undeniable development returns of a healthy population, we need to invest in strengthening health systems to deliver high quality services. And we need to invest in the infrastructure  roads, water, energy  that make stronger health systems possible and accessible. We need to address head on the systemic gender inequalities that hamper women's empowerment, their health and their options in life, and that prevent redress when their human rights are violated. And we need comprehensive sexuality education, which empowers young people to make responsible, autonomous decisions about their sexual and reproductive health. CSE that emphasizes gender and power reduces rates of sexually transmitted infections, HIV and unintended pregnancy and enables young people to stay healthy. This promotes gender equality, mutual respect, tolerance and non-violence. It helps young people plan their lives and develop lifelong healthy behaviours. Madam Chairperson, Half of all non-communicable diseases can be attributed to behaviours that begin in childhood and adolescence, such as tobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diets or lack of physical activity. Reaching young people, both in and out of school, early in life to foster positive life-long health behaviours is key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of health and well-being for all. Investing in the health, education and employment of young people today is the best investment to improve the lives of older persons tomorrow. Delivering on the rights and aspirations of young people will set the stage for a second demographic dividend of ageing, as we live longer and healthier, enjoy our grandchildren  and great grandchildren  while society shares and benefits from our prosperity. Acting Now The global challenges we now face have been decades in the making. It will require a long-term approach to address them. We must begin now. This year, over 59 million girls will turn 10 years of age. That's another 59 million chances to do it right, to catalyze the dramatic transformations they  and we  so desperately need. We can't afford to wait until next year, the next CPD, the next generation. These investments take time and resources. And although we know they will bring enormous returns, those too take time to see. There are always more immediate issues to address  other ""priorities"". Time and time again, these have taken precedence. How many girls have we let down over the years? Let us not tell the next girl, the next generation of girls, that they are next in line to be let down for the pursuit of other priorities. Let us not continue sacrificing the precious potential of tens of millions. If we do, we will find ourselves in 2030 with inequalities widening, innovation stagnating, and still no closer to achieving sustainable development. Let us take a different path. Let us make the necessary investments in young people that you committed to during the ICPD review. Let's not have the same conversations 15 years from now that we are having today. Addressing Challenges: Inequality, Fragility, Climate Change We face a highly unequal word, where so many have been left out. Investing in the rights and prospects of all people is the only way to address these inequalities and ensure that growth is inclusive and durable. We face enormous fragilities and vulnerabilities  more people than ever displaced by conflict, and weak systems and infrastructure that leave too many places at risk of collapse when crisis strikes. Climate change impacts will continue to grow, driven in large part by ever-increasing consumption and our reliance on fossil fuels. The climate agreement that we hope will be signed this year in Paris can help mitigate this threat if we can implement it in synergy with the sustainable development goals. The poor and marginalized are least equipped to cope with climate change impacts. They need our support to build lives and livelihoods that are resilient, flexible and adaptable. Universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights is a recipe for resilience. When these rights are not protected, too many women and girls enter a spiral of early marriage and early pregnancy that severely limits their options and those of their households. This undermines their ability to reduce their risk before a crisis, cope during and recover after. And evidence shows that gender-based violence escalates and services disappear during crisis, meaning women and girls are doubly vulnerable. Robust health systems and the ability to ensure rights and services across the humanitarian-development continuum are key to resilience. Population Dynamics and Data Amidst uncertainty and in search of new prospects, more and more people are moving internally and internationally, especially to urban areas, driving one of the largest demographic transformations we have ever seen. By 2030 the world will have 1 billion new urban residents, primarily in Africa and Asia. Migration and urbanization can catalyze new forms of growth, resilience and sustainability, greater access to services and opportunity, and more equal development. But this will only happen if we recognize and plan for where people are and where they will be. The field of population provides incredibly robust projections that enable us to do just that. Today we can look back at the Programme of Action and marvel at how well we could predict 20 years ago the population of today. Yet our projections, our understanding of the population, are only as good as the data that go into them. We need to significantly increase investments in data and statistical capacity, so we can leverage census, survey and administrative data to plan for and monitor people-centred sustainable development. We also need to leverage the data revolution. Rapid advances in big data and analytics can enable us to better identify and support those most in need, who may be lost in traditional data systems and aggregate statistics  young people who are moving to cities in vast numbers, and those too often forgotten or excluded, including women and girls, older persons, the poor and marginalized, internally displaced persons and refugees. National Statistical Offices have always been a crucial partner in the implementation of the ICPD and its data-driven mandate. As we face the challenges and opportunities of planning and monitoring the Post-2015 development agenda in a much broader and more integrated way, ICPD will continue to provide a framework for using data to guide us to sustainable development and to assess our progress honestly and transparently. Integrating Population Issues into Sustainable Development Last year at this Commission, and in September at the Special Session of the UN General Assembly devoted to ICPD beyond 2014, Member States reaffirmed the ICPD as a guidepost for sustainable development. This year, let us recognize ICPD beyond 2014 as a means of achieving and monitoring many dimensions of the Post-2015 agenda. The new development agenda is broad, ambitious and diverse because it reflects the tremendous challenges we face and the goals we must reach. Integrating population issues into it, as you are called to do here, will enable us to build on lessons learned from 20 years of ICPD, on the nature of our population now and in the future, and most of all on the achievement of dignity and human rights for all. Let this next generation of young people be the first to grow up with all of their rights realized -- empowered, educated, employed and deployed as drivers of a better future for all of us. We have 59 million chances to get it right. If we do so, we will be well on our way to sustainable development. If we do so, by 2030, today's 59 million 10-year-old girls will be 25-year-olds living with their brothers in dignity, equality, health and well-being. We can't afford to wait. The time is now. Let's make it happen. Thank you. Check against delivery."
NA,"press","09 April 2018","    Speech  Statement of the Executive Director to the Commission on Population and Development 09 April 2018   Mr. Chairperson,Deputy Secretary-GeneralDistinguished members of the Commission,Distinguished delegates,Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour to address the 51st session of the Commission on Population and Development. This is my first such opportunity as Executive Director of UNFPA, and it is a privilege to be here with the champions of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, known as the ICPD Programme of Action The Commission chose for this years theme the intersection of several issues at the core of population dynamics and the human condition  our mobility and migration, and how we come together in cities. These are very important, and very complex issues. And they are, at their heart, about people. About their lives, their health, their rights, their safety and their opportunities. As Shakespeare wrote, What is the city but the people? UNFPA recently interviewed young migrants in the gateway cities of Cairo, Beirut and Tunis about their experiences, as part of a multi-city research project. They told us of the desperation in the places they left. They were drawn to those cities because of insecurity and unrest where they grew up. And these young people were very honest with us: They face serious risks and abuses during and after their moves, and things are much harder than they had expected. Even so, they almost universally say  they would do it all over again. Brave young people seeking a better life, and they are joined in this quest by people of all ages, from everywhere. An estimated one billion people alive today are migrants, and as of last year, 2017, more than 65 million people were forcibly displaced  a record high. The majority on the move cluster in cities and towns. They move with the expectation of a better life. How do we deliver on the better life they seek in a way that equally supports both the people on the move and those who host them upon arrival? Addressing the Drivers of Mobility and Migration At the core of the ICPD Programme of Action and the 2030 Agenda is the commitment to address the drivers of migration  by creating a world where all persons are free from poverty, illness, discrimination, violence and the consequences of conflict or climate change. Climate change demands our shared, and deepening commitment, being a key driver of food insecurity and migration. A word about young people. Governments do recognize the importance of increased and sustained investments in young people to respond to a rapidly changing world, and to achieve these ends. This is one reason that the pursuit of the demographic dividend, a social and economic boon that comes from providing educational and economic opportunities for young people, has become such a widespread priority and rallying cry. We aim to build and sustain peace, to reduce the record displacements caused by conflict, and to speed the pace and possibility of return. A powerful study just released, builds upon Security Council Resolution 2250 on Youth Peace and Security. The study was commissioned by the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office and supported by UNFPA. It shows that at least one in four young people around the world is affected by violence or armed conflict. The study debunks the myth that bulging youth populations present an increased risk of violence. Itshowcases, in fact, how every day young people work in their communities to generate peace, improve governance, and advocate for their rights. Let us invest in young people  in their empowerment, health, rights, education and employment  and let us put our trust in them to help solve the challenges we face together. The demographic dividend then leads to a peace dividend. Development expands peoples horizons and aspirations, and it provides the means for mobility. This is why, despite what many think, people from the least developed countries are significantly less likely to be found outside their countries of origin. Protection in Transit and at Destination Let me now focus on protection in transit and at destination. As people move, they face hazards along their journey. When migrants are separated from family and support networks, their chances of exploitation, violence, and victimization from human trafficking become much higher. Women and girls are particularly vulnerable to violence and discrimination. Gender-based violence, already the most common human rights violation, only increases with disruption and displacement. And far too much evidence shows that child, early and forced marriage increases as well. So I would ask you to bear in mind that the lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services is a major contributing factor to death, disease and disability among displaced women and girls of reproductive age. At UNFPA, we have declared safe birth, even here because migration while pregnant can increase risk of complications. Therefore, pregnant women may be left behind, while others seek safer locations. And those left behind may face continued threats, often exacerbated by a collapsing health system. That is why ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights for all people is so critical. This must include migrant and mobile populations, refugees and crisis-affected people. And let us effect changes that remove the barriers that keep them from accessing services and realizing their rights. Barriers like cost, overcrowded health centres, language differences, lack of transportation options, pollution, insecure housing and more. If cities are the people, then lets equip cities to deliver for the people. All people, including migrants on the move. Strong evidence shows that greater integration produces less discrimination and offers new possibilities for social inclusion and equality, especially in the highly diverse gateway cities where migrants often land. Services and interventions that target everyone in need  whether mobile or local host community  can also help bridge divides between groups, and generate the greatest good and provide a path to combatting the discrimination, xenophobia, racism and indeed violence that has emerged in some places around the world. Population Data on Cities, Mobility and Migration In closing I will now turn to the importance of high-quality population data to address challenges and seize opportunities related to cities, migration and mobility. To know more, and in detail, about the situation of urban populations, we will need better data and analysis. This Commission plays an indispensable, singular role in supporting such efforts. The particular constellation of issues we address this year places massive new demands on data systemsand the truth is, many countries simply are not yet ready. The more mobile a person, the less likely she is to appear in a data system  with the exception of formal registration for refugees. And we have inadequate information for internally displaced populations. Let me underscore the need for qualitative data that helps us understand the motivations, and life circumstances, of migrants. UNFPA advocates for better data systems that can give us the information necessary to understand and locate those in need, so that investments can be better directed to truly reach the furthest behind first. With adequate resources and shared action we can fulfill the promise of the ICPD Programme of Action to everyone who is still waiting nearly 25 years since Cairo. At UNFPA, on the eve of our 50th anniversary next year, as well as ICPD at 25, we are focusing on achieving three strategic results: zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths, and zero violence and harmful practices against women and girls. All predicated on a platform of quality population data that will help us ensure that everyone is accounted for and reached. These are ambitious aims. Yet, in total dollars and as a proportion of official development assistance  the funding to the sector that works on sexual and reproductive health has plateaued since 2011. And funding for population data and policy analysis plateaued back in 2005. Let our deliberations over the coming week mobilize us to realize the vision of Cairo for all. Final Thoughts Let me close with a memory. Last year, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, our late Executive Director, addressed you from this chair. He spoke to me about the confidence he and his predecessors placed in this Commission, and his belief that the statements you make, and the outcomes you negotiate, are essential to place the health and rights of women and girls at the centre of population and sustainable development, where they belong. I know that this week may bring challenges. Therefore, as you negotiate, allow me to encourage you, and all of us, first and foremost, to think about the vulnerable women and girls around the world who, every day, face the important issues that this Commission is addressing. Bearing them in mind, I urge you to spare no efforts to ensure a successful, consensual outcome, knowing that you will help deliver a better world for everyone. Everywhere. I pledge the full support of UNFPA to Member States to achieve this goal. Thank you.    "
NA,"press","11 March 2016","    Press Release  Unleash the Power of Adolescent Girls of the SDG Generation to Propel Progress for People, Planet, Says UNFPA 11 March 2016   UNITED NATIONS, New YorkDespite advances in recent years, girls continue to suffer from discrimination and exclusion just because they are young and female, warned Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, Executive Director of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund. For many girls, added Dr. Osotimehin, puberty marks an accelerating trajectory into inequality. Investing in adolescent girls, he emphasized, can help boost their potential and achieve gender equality and progress for societies at large. Dr. Osotimehin made these strong appeals during a high-level event held today at the United Nations to discuss how investing in adolescent girlsespecially in education and health, including sexual and reproductive healthwill promote sustainable development for all of humanity. The event featured representatives of governments and international organizations, as well as experts and young people from around the world. Many of the 600 million adolescent girls in the world face daily discrimination and rights violations. Too often, they are taken out of school, married off and pressured to bear children before they are ready, risking their health, their lives and their futures. When girls are free to define their lives and enjoy their rights, they not only enjoy better health and healthier children; they are also better able to contribute to national development as economic actors and entrepreneurs, helping their countries reap the demographic dividend and driving economic growth, Dr. Osotimehin stated. Investments in the health, education and employment of young people, particularly adolescent girls, are among the most cost-effective development expenditures, experts say. An extra year of girls education can cut infant death by up to 10 per cent. Secondary education is singularly effective in delaying the age at which a young woman first gives birth, and each year of secondary schooling increases girls future wages by up to 20 per cent. When women and girls earn income, they reinvest 90 per cent of it into their families. By adopting the Sustainable Development Agenda at the United Nations last September, world leaders resolved to promote gender equality and empower women and girls. That includes by eliminating violence and harmful practices, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation. By prominently featuring girls rights in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the international community has responded enthusiastically to the evidence that investing in girls yields huge returns, explained Dr. Osotimehin. The success of the new agenda, he added, will be measured in how well we are collectively able to build a world in which girls have no limits on their aspirations for the future, no matter where they are born.

NA,"press","19 September 2016","    Speech  Statement of Executive Director on addressing drivers of migration 19 September 2016   Presented by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin to Roundtable 2 - ""Addressing drivers of migration, particularly large movements, and highlighting the positive contributions of migrants"" - at the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants. Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is an honour and a pleasure to address this roundtable. Within the overall framework of the 2030 Agenda and the continued implementation of the ICPD Beyond 2014, UNFPA stands ready to support Member States in implementing the commitments made in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. The drivers of migration are complex. They are specific to each country, and each individual. They reflect a basic hope that life will be better in a different place  a hope that often reflects reality, given the stark inequalities in economic opportunity and human rights between countries. At UNFPA, we are committed to addressing the drivers of migration By advocating for the empowerment of all young people, and working for and with them to expand their life chances and choices at home through better health and a greater voice in decisions that affect them. By expanding our leadership on the demographic dividend and convening our development partners to ensure that young people are empowered, educated and employed, and prepared for and able to contribute to innovation. By supporting women and girls, who make up an increasing proportion of migrants. We must ensure their rights and opportunities at home  including their right to education, the freedom to marry when and whom they choose, to have children when and if they choose, their rights to reproductive health, to be free from gender-based violence and discrimination, and their opportunities for work and leadership. Second, UNFPA is committed to protecting those in transit Our humanitarian programmes are protecting women, girls and young people in more than 60 countries today, including economic migrants and those fleeing situations of conflict and environmental crisis. Our offices in transit countries are active in the provision of relief and protection to thousands of women and girls, assuring access to sexuality education and information, reproductive health services, family planning, dignity kits, and counsel and emergency care for those subjected to gender-based violence. Finally, we are committed to improving Data on Migrants UNFPA will capitalize on its unique relationship with National Statistical Offices around the world to advocate for including the core migration census questions in the 2020 census round, so that we can get more comprehensive data. And, as a member of the Global Migration Group, we are ready to work more closely with our UN partners to advance innovative data-gathering tools to monitor the movements, composition and needs of migrants  including through non-traditional sources, such as border interviews, aerial surveys and satellite imaging. Let me conclude by affirming UNFPAs commitment to supporting Member States in addressing large movements of refugees and migrants using a gender-responsive, human rights-based approach. Thank you very much.   "
NA,"news","17 January 2014","News  India Launches its National Adolescent Health Strategy   17 January 2014   NEW DELHI  Indias recent decision to launch a national adolescent health strategy aimed at addressing the critical health concerns of adolescents in the country, indicates the Governments determination to put youth at the centre of its priorities. In a nation where a fifth of the population is aged 10-19, the broad benefits of healthier youth will have a profound impact on the future prospects of the whole population. Launched by the Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Ghulam Nabi Azad, in New Delhi on January 7 and developed with the support of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, this strategy will provide health, information and services to fulfil the needs of adolescents, including girls and marginalized groups, a 243 million strong, yet very vulnerable cohort. The adolescent birth rate among 15-19 year-old female adolescents in India is 76 out of 1,000.The strategy recognizes that only policies and programmes focusing on the rights and well-being of the large and increasing adolescents and youth population in India can translate into a demographic dividend for the countrythe accelerated economic growth that can result from a rapid decline in a countrys fertility rate coupled with smart investments in health, education and job creation. Addressing adolescent health needs would obviate several reproductive, maternal and child health challenges, said Ms Anuradha Gupta, the Director of Indias National Rural Health Mission, an initiative undertaken by the Government of India to address the health needs of underserved rural areas and one of the worlds largest public health programmes. Age at marriage, birth preparedness, appropriate spacing, teenage pregnancy and mortality and morbidity associated with it can be addressed only when we start to work with adolescents, both boys and girls, and their caregivers.Invited by the Government of India to attend the launch, UNFPA Deputy Executive Director Kate Gilmore said, The vision that drives the programme is panoramic in scale, and a mastery of public health. It is unprecedented in its dimension. UNFPA has been instrumental in advocating the for the inclusion of adolescents in the countrys large public health programme on reproductive health. By investing in adolescent health today, we invest in the workforce, parents, and leaders of tomorrow, and break the inter-generational cycle of poor health. Investments in adolescents will have an immediate, direct and positive impact on Indias health goals and on the achievement of several Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In a joint statement by UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, USAID and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, renewing their commitment to support implementation of the strategy, UNFPA India Representative Frederika Meijer said, We all agree that for successfully addressing adolescent needs, a multisectoral, holistic approach is required with multiple stakeholders involved. The participation of adolescents in all stages of implementation is absolutely essential if we are to fulfil the agenda of adolescents and young people."
NA,"press","30 April 2014","Press Release  260 parliamentarians from 6 continents reaffirm strong support for population, development agenda 30 April 2014   UNITED NATIONS, New York, 28 April 2014  At the sixth global parliamentarians conference on population and development, held in Stockholm from 23 to 25 April, parliamentarians from 134 countries issued their strongest call ever to implement the Programme of Action agreed to at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994. The parliamentarians committed to mobilize their constituencies and governments to make bold efforts to ensure that the principles of the Cairo Programme of Action are fully integrated in the post-2015 global development agenda and that human rights, gender equality, women and young people are at its heart. The Stockholm Statement of Commitment, which was agreed upon unanimously by all the parliamentarians present, emphasized the critical links between a countrys population and its ability to achieve sustained economic development. They called for the integration of population dynamics in all development planning at national and subnational levels as a critical foundation for sustainable development. Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, Executive Director of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, reminded the parliamentarians of their crucial role in directing the future of international development by transforming the conferences outcome into concrete action. He emphasized their responsibility towards those who need their support the most, saying, Let us not forget the people that count on us. Let us not forget the most marginalized young girl. The actions you as Parliamentarians take to transform her life will transform our world. The outcome of this conference gives more legitimacy to our efforts to place sexual and reproductive health and rights, with special focus on young people, in the centre of the new global development agenda, he added. The rights of adolescents and young people also featured centrally in the Statement of Commitment, most notably the need to keep the girl child, including married girls and pregnant girls, in school at all levels of education without discrimination. Recognizing the opportunities offered by young people, parliamentarians also agreed to commit to design policies and programmes that harness the demographic dividend through enhancing the capabilities of young people to contribute to social and economic development and innovation. In addition to the main Statement of Commitment, a Declaration on Human Rights was adopted by acclamation by the participants. In this document, the parliamentarians call on all States to guarantee equality before the law and non-discrimination for all people, by adopting laws and policies to protect the human rights of all individuals, without distinction of any kind. The Stockholm Conference was organized by UNFPA and the European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development, together with the Swedish Parliament, the Swedish All-Party Parliamentary Group on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, and the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It followed similar global conferences in Istanbul in 2012, Addis Ababa in 2009, Bangkok in 2006, Strasbourg in 2004 and Ottawa in 2002.

Their Addis Ababa Action Agenda provides a foundation for implementing the global sustainable development agenda that the leaders are expected to adopt in September. UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, welcomed the Action Agenda. Todays commitment to a new social compact to end poverty and to finish the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals is a boon to millions of women and girls all over the world, said Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, the Funds Executive Director. Such goals include promoting maternal health and ending preventable maternal death. By todays action, world leaders have told todays 10-year-old girl that, by the time she is 25, they would have catalyzed additional investments in her education, health and rights, so she can fulfill her potential and hold up half the sky in pursuit of development, added Dr. Osotimehin. These investments can help her get education, including comprehensive sexuality education, and reproductive health, so she can ensure for herself that every pregnancy is wanted and every childbirth is safe. By their action, the leaders have committed to helping reduce the number of women who die or suffer injuries as they give life. Going further, Dr. Osotimehin added: Todays commitment to make the critical investments in young people, to educate, employ and empower them can unleash a demographic dividend that can speed up human capital development that accelerates countries economic growth and poverty eradication. In Addis Ababa Action Agenda, leaders also agreed to: The position that investing in young people is critical to sustainable development, and recognized the need to support countries in making the requisite investments. Strong international support for national investments in services, such as health and education. Promote national youth strategies to meet the needs and aspirations of young people, including a global strategy for youth employment by 2020. Enhance national health systems and achieve universal health coverage. Strengthen countries capacity for early warning, risk-reduction and management of national and global health risks. That includes substantially increasing health financing and recruiting and training health workers in developing countries. Recognize the need for more timely, comprehensive and cost-effective ways to manage and mitigate natural disasters and complex emergencies, and committed to helping countries achieve that. They would invest in strengthening national and local capacity to manage and finance disaster-risk reduction, and to get international assistance, when needed. *** For more information or media inquiries, please contact: Abubakar Dungus, Chief of the Media and Communications Branch, UNFPA; E-mail: dungus@unfpa.org Abraham Gelaw, Communications Unit, UNFPA Ethiopia; E-mail: gelaw@unfpa.org;Tel. +251 11 5444079; +251 91 1488627   "
NA,"news","07 December 2011","News  Your Life, Your Rights, Your Contraception   Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, executive director of UNFPA (second from left) and President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal (right) at the family planning conference in Dakar.  07 December 2011   DAKAR, Senegal  The 2,400 experts, leaders and advocates attending the second International Conference on Family Planning here called for scaling up best practices to face the high demand for family planning that goes unmet. During the event, which was held 29 November to 2 December, the participants -- including 3 first ladies, 17 ministers and donors and parliamentarians -- advocated for universal access to family planning and shared research findings, notably in Africa, America and Asia, through more than 385 presentations and 60 luncheon panels. As Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, executive director of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, said at the conference, Family planning is like oxygen, everyone breathes it. By the first day, the United Kingdom announced a pledge of nearly $55 million to UNFPA, while the president of Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade, committed about $1.7 million to family planning, the first such donation for the country. The forum was organized by the Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population and Reproductive Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Senegalese government, with collaboration from UNFPA and others. The first conference was held in Kampala, Uganda, two years ago. On 30 November, a high-level ministerial meeting was attended by ministers of health, government officials and development partners, including UNFPA. They shared how they have taken advantage of the so-called demographic dividend of youths in their countries, as Asia did in the past to help drive economies. Integrating family planning services On World AIDS Day, 1 December, experts took part in a Future of Family Planning and HIV Integration session. Discussing recent research suggesting a link between hormonal contraception and HIV risk, the panelists agreed that the evidence was inconclusive. A global consultation will be convened by the World Health Organization early next year to issue a joint statement on the matter.   A UNFPA table at the family planning conference in Dakar, 2011, which emphasized paying attention to the needs of youth and to improving maternal health. Experts also said that it was impossible to make headway in preventing the spread of HIV without investing in family planning at the same time. Globally, AIDS is one of the leading causes of death among women of reproductive age and a major cause of poor maternal health, especially in places with high prevalence of the disease. The experts therefore called for a comprehensive approach to integrating family planning and coping with HIV-related issues, saying that women and men, including those living with HIV and AIDS, need access to a full range of affordable, quality information, services and commodities. More funding for UNFPA Stephen OBrien, under-secretary of state for the British Department of International Development, announced an additional 5 million pledge (about $8 million) from his government to the UNFPA Global Programme to Enhance Reproductive Health Commodity Security to obtain at least 13.5 million female condoms. The pledge complements Britain's pledge of 35m (about $55 million) for family planning in poor countries, announced on 29 November. This donation will enable a rapid-response-style unit to procure and deliver contraceptives to countries facing low supplies while governments work on better long-term arrangements. Meeting demands of young people At a press conference on 2 December, UNFPA officials, led by Werner Haug, director of the Technical Division, clarified UNFPA key messages: that family planning should be part of a comprehensive sexual and reproductive health approach; that access to family planning, sex education and broader education is a priority for young people; that country ownership is vital for the success of such programmes; and that there is a need to focus on reducing unmet needs for family planning. Time has come to scale up in demand creation, Haug stressed. At a separate event outside the family planning conference, he handed over $1.7 million of reproductive health goods, including contraceptives, from UNFPA to Senegal. Back at the conference, Faustin Yao, director of UNFPA subregional office for West and Central Africa, hailed the progress so far in family planning in West Africa, but he noted that the pace is still slow because of sociological and infrastructure problems and the unavailability of contraceptives, including to young people. ""This conference was not about what we should do, Yao said. We already know what to do and it is now time to do it, time to act on what works and what produce results. Government leadership success in Malawi on family planning has led to a contraceptive-prevalence rate that jumped to 46 per cent in 2010 from 7 percent in 1992, said Dr. Dorothy Nyasulu, a Malawi assistant representative. UNFPA is a key partner in Malawi for the Reproductive Health Commodity Security program.  Speaking at the opening plenary session, Dr. Osotimehin reiterated that investing in voluntary family planning today will not only pay dividends now, but will also help historys largest generation of young people enjoy opportunities and forge a brighter future. As T-shirts sold by youths on the last day of the conference put it: Your life, your rights, your contraception.  Hugues Kon"
NA,"press","11 April 2016","    Speech  Statement of Executive Director to the Commission on Population and Development 11 April 2016   Remarks of UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin to the 49th session of the Commission on Population and Development on strengthening the demographic evidence base for achieving the ICPD beyond 2014 and SDGs. Mr. Secretary-General,Madam Chairperson,Excellencies,Distinguished delegates,       Ladies and gentlemen, Good morning! It is a pleasure to address this 49th Session of the Commission on Population and Development. I would like to thank Ambassador Mwaba Kasese-Bota and the Commission for their work in preparing for this session. Let me also thank Under-Secretary-General Wu and the Department of Economic and Social Affairs for their partnership with UNFPA in supporting the work of the Commission. The world is deeply dependent on the community assembled in this room  more so than it knows. We are faced with a huge challenge, put to us by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The UN Statistics Commission has agreed on 230 indicators to measure progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and its critical aspirations for human well-being and the survival of the planet. At least half of these indicators depend directly on demographic data. So the commitment of this community to strengthen the evidence base for sustainable development is crucial. Leaving no one behind The 2030 Agenda is built on the assumption that every country will be able to identify and locate the most vulnerable people, identify interventions that result in the greatest improvements in their welfare, and monitor progress over a wide array of goals and targets. This work is at the heart of ensuring that no one is left behind. It is key to reaching those furthest behind first. These same aims echo the recommendations of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action, the Key Actions for its further implementation in 1999, and the Framework of Actions for the follow up to the ICPD beyond 2014. Each of these documents crafts a vision of sustainable development based on the achievement of universal human rights and equality, of universal access to health, including sexual and reproductive health, of non-discrimination that embraces gender equality and womens empowerment, of quality education, security of place, economic opportunity, and the dignity of all persons. Yet, in far too many countries, redressing population inequalities and measuring progress towards sustainable development is constrained by a lack of core population data, by weak data systems, and under-developed capacity to use such data for development. Building up and sustaining core population data requires strengthening both census and civil registration and vital statistics. Information on births and deaths enables countries to confer and guarantee citizenship, and to plan public infrastructure development and the delivery of health and education services.  Civil registration is essential for the protection and exercise of human rights. The right to be counted is fundamental to social inclusion. CRVS systems ensure that countries can plan effective public health policies, measure the impact of health programmes, proactively respond to epidemics and halt the spread of disease. We need to significantly increase our investments in civil registration and vital statistics. But the pace of expansion in CRVS has increased enormously, and the goal of universal coverage is reachable. It took two centuries for Europe to ensure universal coverage, but it has taken South Africa just over two decades to achieve 95 percent coverage. But even with a powerful demographic evidence base built on better census, civil registration and other data, we will still need to develop better ways to reach those who have historically gone uncounted  the young child living in a remote community cut off from access to birth registration the person who dies unattended and undiagnosed refugees, undocumented migrants, and those displaced by war or environmental crises the homeless or slum dwellers. Advances in Big Data hold huge potential. Satellite imagery and call detail records can be used for real time analysis and estimation of those on the move, or in difficult-to-reach areas or humanitarian crises. But these approaches still need a strong demographic evidence base for cross-checking estimations. We need to embrace innovations and developments in Big Data and integrate them into the worlds growing data ecosystems. From production to use We know, from long experience, however, that improving data collection alone is not sufficient. UNFPAs extensive evaluation of the 2010 round of censuses revealed that growing support for the collection of census data, and even measurable improvements in dissemination, have not been matched by growing use. Much more could have been done with geographic information systems, mapping and spatial analysis to find and support vulnerable populations, especially in developing countries. Many countries are even failing to fully use census data as a planning tool for schools, hospitals and other public infrastructure. These shortfalls reflect a lack of trained human capital. How ironic that this coincides with the problem of underemployment and poverty. The growing demand for higher education across the world speaks to the potential for an education revolution  and that will be needed to ensure that national data institutions and capacity can fulfill the aspirations and ambitions of the ICPD and the 2030 Agendas. The ICPD Programme of Action recognized the centrality of education for development. The 2030 Agenda does so as well, setting targets for universal primary and secondary education. But we need to go further. In todays dynamic global economy, tertiary education is essential. The demographic dividends experienced by the so-called Asian Tiger economies during the second half of the 21st century reflected extraordinary growth in the scale and quality of education, often within a generation. This contributed to an acceleration in overall development. We need a revolution not only in national data systems in developing countries but in education systems, so that the coming generation of young people  girls and boys alike  will leap-frog beyond the opportunities of their parents. We need to ensure that they become the next generation of population and data experts  ideally with the integrated, human-rights based vision of sustainable development found in the ICPD and the 2030 Agenda. Raising the political priority of the demographic evidence base Right now, the worlds attention is on data, driven by the important process of generating an indicator framework for the SDGs, but also by the amazing technological advances in Big Data. We welcome this attention. We need it. Stronger data systems are urgently required not only for countries to measure the Agenda 2030 indicators, but for the fulfilment of the vision and values of the ICPD Programme of Action.  Which brings me to national ownership and the definition of national success. Success will be measured by whether or not the institutions and data professionals in government, academia, the private sector and civil society collectively advance the empowerment of the vulnerable, especially women and girls. Success will be measured by whether they expand the opportunities and capacity of every young person and uphold the dignity and human rights of all people. Let us leave this Commission with a strong resolution to strengthen the data systems of our respective countries, and to use those systems to respond to the yearnings of those furthest behind for a better life. By doing so, we will ensure that all of us advance down the path we began in Cairo in 1994, the path to a more sustainable, prosperous, inclusive future  together. I look forward to travelling that path with you and to a productive week to come. Thank you.            "
NA,"news","24 June 2013","News  A Platform for Voices of Arab Youth in a Critical Time   UNFPA Executive Director Babatunde Osotimehin meets with young people at the the Regional Population and Development Conference in Cairo.  24 June 2013   CAIRO -- Under the theme of 'Development Challenges and Population Dynamics in a Changing Arab Region', the Regional Population and Development Conference (24-26 June) provides a platform for young people to be heard at this pivotal time in the Arab region and to help shape the population and development agenda for the post-2015 framework. Young people in the Arab States have been at the heart of recent movements for change in the region. They continue to influence the democratic and demographic transitions in their countries, and to claim their rights for inclusion and participation. With 60 per cent of the Arab regions population below the age of 25 and about one in five between the ages of 15 and 24, young people represent a crucial demographic and socioeconomic dividend.  ""Arab youth have become aware of the brush in their hand and the time is now to start painting the reality that we want, said Marovan Ben Larbi, the Focal Point for the Youth Peer Education Network (Y-PEER) in Morocco. ""Youth can play a pivotal part in transforming our region, said Ahmad Alhendawi, the United Nation Secretary-Generals Envoy on Youth in his keynote address. Young people are our opportunity, and we ought to invest in them and respond to their claims for rights. The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action underscores that countries need focus on the human rights and needs of young people, who are often are less able to access their human rights and less likely to benefit from economic development. Aspirations of Arab youth The voices of the vibrant and engaged Arab youth are emerging stronger than ever in their respective national contexts. A youth perspective needs to be incorporated in the way forward so that youth experiences and aspirations will guide policy makers in our countries, says Lynn Darwich from the Coalition for Sexual and Bodily Rights in Muslim Societies in Lebanon. Recent movements for change have underscored the fact that Arab youth possess an unique ability to mobilize , voice their concerns and future aspirations, and empower themselves with relevant information and knowledge to ensure that they make relevant choices to lead meaningful lives that will benefit them, their families and society. I see the emerging political and socioeconomic environment in the Arab region as an opportunity for the youth; we have an outlet now to share and discuss our issues, said Alaa Khach of Y-Peer Syria. We also need to take responsibility to be the voice of the still voiceless youth in our region. Civic engagement Arab youth understand their realities and the steps that need to be taken to transform bring about meaningful progress better than anyone. They are willing and able to be considered as stakeholders in decisions influencing them from the community to policy level. In some cases young Arab girls are forced into marriage and staying at home against their, which exemplifying the gender inequalities we ought to reverse in our region, said Nermeen Al Qadi of theSharek Youth Forum in Palestine. The Arab Youth Report, the Road toward Citizenship and Participation presented at the The Regional Population and Development Conference in Cairo recommends that policy makers consider youth as active partners and human capital to be invested in. The report also calls for addressing the multidimensional nature of the current exclusion of youth. Members of the Arab Youth Coalition shared their concrete recommendations to pave the way for more youth inclusion: Arab States ought to embark on establishing a Ministry of Youth, and priorities should be youth participation, youth participation, youth participation, said Alaa Khach. Social media can assist in disseminating the message of young voices broadly across society, added Marovan Ben Larbi of Y-PEER Morocco. The networks of performers, singers, writers and others can also be used in innovative ways. The Arab Youth Coalition is a forum of youth from across the Arab region facilitated by the UNFPA Arab States Regional Office. Collective call  collective response At the session on Young People Shaping their Future, United Nations Youth Envoy Ahmad Alhendawi enthusiastically voiced the aspirations of youth by presenting the Call for Action by the Arab Youth Coalition. The idea of coming together as a collective forum is amazing and I believe that being united will pave the way towards making our opinions heard in our dialogue with our policy makers,said Nermeen Al Qadi of the Sharek Youth Forum in Palestine."
NA,"news","25 September 2013","News  World Leaders Resolve to Speed Up Work to Achieve MDGs   25 September 2013   UNITED NATIONS, New York  World leaders committed today to stepping up their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  particularly in areas where progress has stalled, including universal access to primary education, child mortality, universal access to reproductive health, including maternal health, and others.   UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin. &copy UN Photo/Rick Bajornas  In an outcome document adopted at a Special Event on the MDGs, Member States recognized that promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls underpin and advance progress across all the Goals. They also committed to promote gender equality and eliminate the range of barriers to women's and girls' empowerment in our societies. During the event, hosted by Ambassador John W. Ashe, President of the UN General Assembly, world leaders also agreed to hold a 2015 Summit to craft a strong post-2015 development agenda, which will build on the foundations laid by the MDGs, complete the unfinished business and respond to new challenges. Todays event also featured the presentation by the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of his report, A Life of Dignity for All, in which he outlines actions to achieve the MDGs and a vision on a new and responsive sustainable development framework. The post-2015 framework must be bold in ambition yet simple in design, supported by a new partnership for development, said the Secretary-General during the event, adding that it also needs to be rights-based, with particular emphasis on women, young people and marginalized groups. We welcome todays commitment to redouble international efforts to achieve the MDGs in the less than 850 days to the 2015 deadline, said Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, Executive Director of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund. This unified resolve by world leaders, and the Secretary-Generals new roadmap, will translate into better lives for millions around the world, particularly the poorest, most vulnerable women and young people, especially adolescent girls. The journey we started in the year 2000 has seen us build a solid foundation for further progress, concluded the Secretary-General. The children born in that year are now entering adolescence  many with the education and health they need for a good start in life, but many more still lacking. As they move into full adulthood, and as our own development efforts mature, let us recognize the important task that is before us. Excerpts from A LIFE OF DIGNITY FOR ALL The Secretary-General lays out his vision beyond 2015 by saying that: Bringing this vision to life will require a number of transformative and mutually reinforcing actions that apply to all countries. Improve health. Address universal health-care coverage, access and affordability; end preventable maternal and child deaths; realize womens reproductive health and rights. Address demographic challenges. While the population of developed countries is projected to remain unchanged at around 1.3 billion, the population of developing countries is projected to increase from 5.9 billion in 2013 to 8.2 billion in 2050. Countries with a high rate of population growth are generally on a path of falling fertility, especially as education for girls and sexual and reproductive health services become more widely available. Progress in these areas would enable many households to slow fertility rates, with consequent benefits for health, education, sustainability and the demographic dividend for economic growth. Countries with a high proportion of young people need to offer education and opportunities for decent work. Countries with an ageing population need policy responses to support the elderly so as to remove barriers to their full participation in society while protecting their rights and dignity. Enhance the positive contribution of migrants. More than a billion people rely on international and domestic migration to improve the income, health and education of their families, escape poverty and conflict and adapt to environmental and economic shocks. Countries receiving migrants can also benefit significantly. Meet the challenges of urbanization. Some 70 per cent of the worlds population will live in cities by 2050. Urbanization poses the challenge of providing city dwellers with employment, food, income, housing, transportation, clean water and sanitation, social services and cultural amenities. At the same time, living in cities creates opportunities for the more efficient delivery and use of physical facilities and amenities. Click here to download the full report  "
NA,"press","11 October 2015","Statement  The Power of the Adolescent Girl: Vision for 2030 11 October 2015   Statement on the International Day of the Girl Child by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin Today, as we celebrate the International Day of the Girl Child, the world has an unprecedented opportunity to focus on the power of girls to drive progress and transform our world. By prominently featuring girls rights in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development last month, the international community has responded enthusiastically to the evidence that investing in girls yields huge returns. The new agenda acknowledges that increased attention to the health and well-being of the worlds adolescent girls, including their sexual and reproductive health, is a necessary condition for success, and calls powerfully for a stronger focus on adolescent girls across sectors. Despite advances in recent years, girls continue to suffer severe disadvantages, discrimination and exclusion, merely for being young and being female. For many girls, puberty marks an accelerating trajectory into inequality. It also represents a critical window for preventive and protective investments that we must make if we are serious about achieving full gender equality. Ensuring that girls are able to exercise their rights, can pursue their education and have the skills and opportunity to join the workforce is essential for their own well-being, and a critical foundation for the health and prosperity of families, communities and nations. These rights include choosing when and whom to marry, when or whether to have children, and being free of violence, abuse and exploitation. When girls are free to define their lives and enjoy their rights, they not only enjoy better health and healthier children; they are also better able to contribute to national development as economic actors and entrepreneurs, helping their countries reap a demographic dividend and driving economic growth. Going forward, we need to increase our efforts to end child marriage, female genital mutilation and other harmful practices affecting girls. We need to give girls unfettered access to comprehensive sexuality education, remove laws that impede their access to information, services and choices, provide them with comprehensive health services, including contraceptive services, and most critically, keep them in school  whether they live in rural or urban areas, whether they are pregnant or not, whether they are married or single. For UNFPA, the success of the 2030 Agenda, which calls on us to leave no one behind, will be measured by how well we are collectively able to build: A world in which girls have no limits on their aspirations for the future, no matter where they are born. A world where adolescent girls have access to sexual and reproductive health information and services and possess the knowledge and confidence they need to make the right choices for a healthy life. A world where every girl can enter freely into a productive adulthood because she is educated, healthy, free from sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV, and not exposed to violence, unintended pregnancy or unsafe abortion. A world where girls are treated with dignity and respect in equal measure with boys and where, regardless of their sex, young peoples human rights are promoted and respected. UNFPA will continue to work with governments, the United Nations system and civil society to make this vision a reality. We commit to the bold pledge of the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind and to prioritize investment in girls as the smart choice for the health and prosperity of all our nations."
NA,"press","25 January 2016","    Press Release  Global leaders call for greater access to family planning 25 January 2016   UNITED NATIONS, New York  President Joko Widodo, of the Republic of Indonesia, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, the Executive Director of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, and numerous global leaders at the International Conference on Family Planning in Nusa Dua, Indonesia, called for urgent action to increase access to family planning services worldwide, which will support the implementation of the new development agenda. I wish that at this conference we can discuss the main foundations necessary to build the planet that we want by 2030, said President Widodo. A future that ensures all women and girls are empowered to choose whether and when they want to have children and space their births, so that mothers and their babies have better opportunities for better lives. ""Family planning is about women's right and their capacity to take decisions about their health and well-being, contributing to the objectives of FP2020, said Dr. Osotimehin. It is a most significant investment to promote human capital development, combat poverty and harness a demographic dividend, thus contributing to equitable and sustainable economic development within the context of the Sustainable Development Goals."" Experts agree that family planning will play a critical role in realizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the new development agenda for the next 15 years, adopted at the United Nations General Assembly last September. Reducing the global unmet need for family planning could save an estimated 1 in 4 women from deaths related to pregnancy or childbirth and prevent 1.1 million infant deaths each year, improving their health and well-being, as well as enhancing their prospects for the future. The conference in Indonesia serves as a platform for partners to revisit global commitments to family planning and speed up progress towards Family Planning 2020 (FP2020)a global partnership focused on enabling an additional 120 million women to access voluntary contraception by 2020and support the implementation of the SDGs. According to the most recent FP2020 progress report, in the last three years 24.4 million more women and girls who want to avoid or delay a pregnancy have begun using modern contraceptives in the worlds poorest countries. This brings the total of women using a modern method of contraception in FP2020s 69 target countries to 290.6 million. However, despite recent progress, millions of women still cannot access the family planning information and tools they need: according to the FP2020 report, modern contraceptive use is behind 2015 projections by 10 million. The family planning data and evidence point to concrete steps we can take as a community to get back on track to meet our FP2020 goal, said Chris Elias, President of Global Development at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Now we must ask ourselves what more we can do to align our efforts to ensure all women have the information and tools they need to time and space their pregnancies.

NA,"events","23 April 2014","2014 International Parliamentarians' Conference on the Implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action Stockholm, Sweden, 23-25 April 2014 The Sixth International Parliamentarians Conference on the Implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action (IPCI/ICPD), took place in Stockholm, Sweden on 23-25 April 2014. The Stockholm Conference was organized by UNFPA and the European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development, together with the Swedish Parliament, the Swedish All-Party Parliamentary Group on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, and the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. IPCI Stockholm came at a very significant time for the ICPD mandate, marking the 20th anniversary Cairo Programme of Action. The Stockholm event focused attention on the links between population issues and sustainable development. In particular, attendees highlighted the importance of protecting the rights of women and adolescents, and of providing comprehensive sexuality education and reproductive health services, to promote economic growth and social development. Achieving inclusive economic and social development requires appropriate legislation, national policies and programmes that guarantee and promote human rights, dignity and equality for all, noted the conferences outcome document, the Stockholm Statement of Commitment. At the end of the three day event, the participants reaffirmed themselves to the ICPD Programme of Action by unanimously adopting theStockholm Statement of Commitment. In it, the parliamentarians committed to mobilize their constituencies and governments to make bold efforts to ensure that the principles of the Cairo Programme of Action are fully integrated in the post-2015 global development agenda and that human rights, gender equality, women and young people are at its heart They called for the integration of population dynamics in all development planning at national and subnational levels as a critical foundation for sustainable development. The parliamentarians pledged, among other actions to: Enact and advocate for the enforcement of laws and policies to respect and protect the sexual and reproductive health and rights of all individuals; Adopt laws to promote and protect human rights and eliminate discrimination without distinction of any kind; Design policies and programmes that harness the demographic dividend through enhancing the capabilities of young people to contribute to social and economic development and innovation; Promote legislation to eliminate child, early and forced marriage, by enacting and enforcing laws on the minimum legal age of marriage of 18 years; and eliminate harmful practices such as female genital mutilation/cutting; Review and repeal laws that punish women and girls who have undergone illegal abortions, as well as end imprisonment for such acts, bearing in mind that in no circumstances should abortion be considered as a family planning method; Advocate for increased development assistance budgets for population assistance, and ensure the target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official development assistance as agreed at the previous IPCI/ICPD conferences; among others. In addition to the main Statement of Commitment, a Declaration on Human Rights was adopted by acclamation by the participants. In this document, the parliamentarians call on all States to guarantee equality before the law and non-discrimination for all people, by adopting laws and policies to protect the human rights of all individuals, without distinction of any kind. The Stockholm conference was attended by more than 260 parliamentarians from 134 countries around 6 continents.

NA,"press","02 June 2015","Speech  Annual Session of the Executive Board 2015 02 June 2015   Statement by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin to the Annual Session of the Executive Board, highlighting results achieved in 2014, the first year of implementation of UNFPA's strategic plan 2014-2017. Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, Colleagues and friends, Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning! Its a pleasure to be here with you once again for the Annual Session of the Executive Board. I always look forward to this opportunity to share with you the highlights of our work over the preceding year, take stock of the lessons learned and look ahead to future challenges and opportunities. This year is particularly significant, as we examine the results achieved in 2014, the first year of implementation of our strategic plan 2014-2017. I am happy to report that we have made good progress, achieving the results we set out to achieve in 2014.   This year is also significant because the world stands on the cusp of a new development era. With the clock ticking down until the end of the MDG time frame, the world is on track to achieve a number of targets -- halving extreme poverty, reducing child deaths, increasing primary school attendance and narrowing the gender gap in school enrolment. But growing inequality threatens the social and economic development gains achieved to date and, if not addressed, will thwart future progress. One of the challenges of the post-2015 era is to deliver development that delivers for all. Yet, we still know the least about  and do the least for  those we need to reach the most. And that is what we must change to build the more just, inclusive future we all want. Rooting out inequality and ensuring the human rights, dignity and well-being of every individual is key to bringing the benefits of development to all. The outcome of the Open Working Group and the negotiations on the post-2015 agenda so far reinforce the conclusion of the ICPD beyond 2014 review that an integrated approach to human rights, resilience, individual capability and opportunity is the basis for transformational, inclusive sustainable development. That is what delegates understood two decades ago in Cairo, and that is what continues to drive our work at UNFPA to this day. In communities and countries, we know we have to go that extra mile, to reach the marginalized women and adolescent girls in remote rural communities or dense urban slums; the young people migrating to cities in search of work and opportunities for a better life; the individuals and families affected by humanitarian crises and conflict; internally displaced persons and refugees; older people in need of support or seeking opportunities to continue to contribute their knowledge and experience to their communities. In our collective efforts to reach the most vulnerable, marginalized and excluded, it is clear that business as usual will not do. Development must take a different path and be tailored to specific country situations. There is no quick-fix, no one-size-fits-all, just the slow hard work of engaging with people, community by community; listening to their needs; designing solutions with them as true partners, taking risks and failing sometimes, but always learning from our mistakes as we pick up and try again. That is how we will reach those most in need  people lost in traditional data systems and aggregate statistics, people hidden in the tyranny of averages  like some of the population groups I just mentioned or like the 10-year-old girl you have heard me speak about so often -- married too early, pregnant too soon, her rights violated, her health and well-being jeopardized, her hopes and dreams stolen from her, her potential squandered. Yesterday, we saw the success of UNFPAs advocacy as representatives of governments, the private sector and civil society met here at the United Nations to discuss ways to reach the worlds 1.8 billion young people. One third of these young people are adolescent girls like that 10-year-old, with unique needs, challenges and hopes for the future. In many developing countries, the youth population presents both challenges and a one-time demographic dividend, an opportunity to trigger rapid economic growth and social development. Discussions around the demographic dividend could not be more relevant to the emerging post-2015 development agenda. This universal agenda challenges countries to accelerate progress across multiple sectors simultaneously and achieve rapid, sustainable development and inclusive growth. The interest in yesterdays high-level event on Youth Employment and the Demographic Dividend, convened by the President of the General Assembly with support from UNFPA and ILO, and participation by the Secretary-General, showed the importance government and private sector leaders, as well as NGOs and young people, attach to this issue. This afternoon, we will make a presentation to the Board on the demographic dividend and its impact on nations economic prospects. We will also highlight UNFPAs work to support countries in making the necessary policy and strategic choices to enable them to realize the demographic dividend. This requires, as we said and continue to say, countries to make the right investments at the right time.  Investments in sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including family planning and contraceptive services; Investments in human capital development  in empowering, educating and employing the largest-ever generation of young people; Investments, in adolescent girls in particular, and in advancing gender equality and womens and girls empowerment; And evidenced-based analysis of population trends to seize the opportunities provided by changing demographic structures. I know these priority actions are familiar to you as members of the Executive Board because they mirror UNFPAs priorities, as outlined in our strategic plan. Your support will be critical in positioning the organization to play its role effectively and in ensuring that the investments needed in young people and women, including their right to sexual and reproductive health information and services, are reflected in the post-2015 agenda. These investments have the potential to transform the face of the developing world, particularly Africa, South Asia and other regions.  Mr. President, Ladies and gentlemen, Our strategic plan puts sexual and reproductive health and realization of reproductive rights squarely at the centre of the Funds work, particularly targeting women and young people, especially adolescent girls. The plan also sets out reforms to improve delivery of results: a strengthened results framework, a new business model and improvements to funding arrangements. UNFPA continues to lead efforts and carry out interventions to accelerate progress on MDG5, with a particular focus on adolescents and youth, and with increasing emphasis on humanitarian preparedness and response. In 2014, UNFPA responded to 34 humanitarian crises and five Level 3 emergencies, in Central African Republic, Iraq, the Philippines, South Sudan and Syria. I just returned from Nigeria, where I saw firsthand our important work to assist women and girls who escaped or were rescued from Boko Haram. We are providing psychosocial support and reproductive health services to them, their families and communities. All told, our humanitarian response work reached 5.4 million women and girls worldwide with services for health and to prevent and address gender-based violence. If I were to sum up our focus in emergencies, I would say, Safety for all, safe birth even here and safety from fear. In the three countries affected by the Ebola outbreak, UNFPA did this and more. We took on the vital work of mobilizing over 8,000 Ebola contact tracers, who monitored more than 90,000 contacts to prevent further transmission. In Sierra Leone, the Fund supported 450,000 women of reproductive age with reproductive health kits. In Guinea, UNFPA supported 10,000 pregnant and Ebola-cured women with hygiene and solidarity kits. And in Liberia the Fund helped equip 370 health facilities nationwide with supplies and equipment for infection prevention and control and reproductive health. UNFPA also launched the Mano River Midwifery Initiative with governments and other partners to increase the number of health workers in the three countries so that women and girls of childbearing age stay healthy and safe despite the crisis. In 2014, we also stepped up implementation of our family planning and adolescent and youth strategies. Further details on this work are available in annexes 8 and 9 of the annual report, which you have before you. With key partners, we launched the Roadmap to Accelerate achievement of Maternal and Newborn Survival and Reach Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 to encourage greater investments in integrated reproductive, maternal and newborn health. We made steady progress on 89 percent of the strategic plan outputs, and the performance of the global and regional interventions was also strong  at 79 percent. Over half of the Funds resources  or $501.2 million  were spent on increasing access to SRH services. Through contraceptive procurement and distribution: tens of thousands of maternal deaths, over 10 million unintended pregnancies and 3.4 million unsafe abortions were averted; nearly 30 million users accessed modern family planning methods; and more than 39 million couples were protected for one year from unwanted pregnancies. Strategic partnerships were key to bringing SRH services to more people. Through the H4+ partnership, together with UNAIDS, UNICEF, UN-Women, the World Bank Group, and the World Health Organization, we created an inter-agency list of essential medical devices for maternal and newborn health and a policy guide for implementing essential interventions for reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health. In partnership with IPPF, UNFPA ensured that the most marginalized and vulnerable people benefit from family planning innovations in over 16 priority countries. We used technology to communicate health messages to young people in the Dominican Republic, and to develop youth-friendly models of care in Bolivia, Dominican Republic and Paraguay. With the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, we are using mobile phones and social media to increase access to reproductive health information and services for young people in Nigeria and Ecuador. And we hope to use this experience to benefit other countries. Together with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, we are joining forces to address HIV and SRH in key countries. Through our Choices not Chance strategy, we continue to increase capacity for family planning services through the Global Programme to Enhance Reproductive Health Commodity Security. Solid progress can be seen in strengthened logistics management, rights-based family planning programmes, and enhanced health communications, outreach and community mobilization, focusing on youth and adolescents. By 2014, 84 countries had a functional logistic management system, and UNFPA supported procurement of contraceptives worth $124 million in 98 countries. Involving the private sector for supply chain management and using SMS-based inventory management reduced contraceptive stock-outs. More women and couples had access to family planning. And 24 countries used the results of emergency obstetric and newborn care needs assessments to scale up maternal and newborn health services. In leading and expanding the global Campaign to End Fistula, more than 10,000 fistula repair surgeries were conducted in 2014. By supporting networks of women living with HIV and young people for HIV prevention, a social movement arose to end AIDS by 2030 and to incorporate youth SRH needs and rights into the post-2015 development agenda. UNFPA remains the largest supplier of both male and female condoms to developing countries, donating over 800,000 male and female condoms in 2014, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. We work in times of peace and crisis. In 2014 UNFPA carried forward the new generation humanitarian strategy, which emphasizes preparedness, response capacity and resilience building. Forty-eight countries now have capacity to implement the minimum initial service package at the onset of crisis. This is a big step forward as we support the rights of women to be safe, to be safe from fear and to have safe birth everywhere. In the Ebola-affected countries, we were able to rapidly respond by switching programme funds to emergency funds and using the surge roster to get experts on the ground quickly. In Central African Republic, Iraq, South Sudan and Syria, 2.7 million women were reached in 2014 with reproductive health services, which included assistance to more than 437,000 deliveries. This gives meaning to safe birth even here. The UNFPA strategy of focusing on priority countries, supported by thematic funds, is building capacity and enabling significant progress in SRH service delivery and prompt humanitarian response. We also made progress on increasing priority on adolescents, especially very young adolescent girls. As a result, 11.6 million adolescents were reached with SRH services 68 per cent of programme countries now have laws and policies that allow adolescents to access SRH services In 63 programme countries, all national comprehensive sexuality education curricula are aligned with international standards and 41 programme countries have health, social and economic asset-building programmes that reach out to adolescent girls at risk of child marriage UNFPA remains a strong champion for ending child marriage, working with the African Union on a campaign to end child marriage across the continent. UNFPA is also the primary partner of a World Bank-funded $170 million project to expand access by women and girls to reproductive, child and maternal health services in five countries in Africas Sahel region and the Economic Community of Western African States. The project includes a major component on empowering adolescent girls. We believe in girl power! This is particularly significant because this is money that governments borrow themselves. Its not money we provide to them. So its very sustainable. 2014 saw progress in advancing gender equality and womens and girls empowerment and reproductive rights. UNFPA supported civil society organizations, including faith-based groups, to promote reproductive rights and womens empowerment. In 30 countries, civil society groups worked to institutionalize programmes for engaging men and boys on gender inequality, SRH and reproductive rights. Our support means that: More than half of programme countries have a gender equality national action plan that includes reproductive rights, with specific targets and national public budget allocations More than half have integrated gender-based violence prevention, protection and response in national SRH programmes, and 54 per cent of programme countries affected by humanitarian crisis have an inter-agency gender-based violence coordination body as a result of UNFPA guidance and leadership. Our work in supporting norms and standards is backed by community mobilization to ensure that local leaders lead change that is sustainable. Success is happening as we work to end female genital mutilation. In 2014, more than 2,000 communities supported by UNFPA declared the abandonment of FGM, and I am pleased to say that my own country, Nigeria, last week enacted a law banning the practice. It was one of the last things President Jonathan did before he left office. Underpinning our work are ongoing efforts to strengthen population and national development policies and international development agendas through integration of evidence-based analysis. I am talking about data for development. In the past 10 years, 104 countries have had at least one census of good quality; and 101 countries have collected, analyzed and disseminated national household survey data for estimation of reproductive health indicators 252 databases are in place in 74 countries, with population-based data accessible through web-based platforms that facilitate mapping of socioeconomic and demographic inequalities 69 per cent of countries have national statistical authorities with the institutional capacity to analyze and use disaggregated data on adolescents and youth. We are working hard to support countries to identify and reach the poor and marginalized with services.  Organizational effectiveness and efficiency Mr. President, In 2014, UNFPA continued to enhance programme effectiveness; mobilization, management and alignment of resources; and adaptability. By developing and implementing the Global Programming System, UNFPA has moved in the right direction, making use of information technologies for more transparent, effective programming, and improved planning and reporting. For the first time, we can analyze in real time programme budgets and expenditures in the context of the expected result (Strategic Plan, Country Programme or donor specific results) and the way programmes are delivered (in line with the business model).  This helps us ensure that the commitments expressed in the documents signed with our implementing partners are backed up by the respective financial provisions. This means that all reported financial figures can be traced back to the relevant programme activities the funds were spent on. This will help improve UNFPAs performance.  Funding/Resource mobilization Mr. President, In 2014, UNFPA mobilized the highest contribution revenue in its history, passing the $1 billion mark, and for this we are grateful. We surpassed the 2014 target for core funding, with $477 million mobilized against a target of $476 million. In co-financing, $525 million was mobilized against a target of $542 million. Total UNFPA expenses in 2014 amounted to $995.6 million. Let me thank Member States once again for their continued support, particularly their core contributions, which are so critical to attaining our strategic plan outcomes. With non-core resources now exceeding core resources, it is vital to ensure that they are harnessed effectively to meet our organizational objectives and managed in accordance with our policies and procedures as well as donor agreements. I am happy to say that the Non-Core Funds Management Unit, which I announced at our session in January, is now up and running. The Unit will ensure non-core funds are allocated to countries with the greatest needs and used effectively. This will facilitate an integrated approach to core and non-core resources, with distinct reporting to donors on the added value of non-core resources in the context of UNFPAs overall work. We continue to diversify our resource base and have strengthened our engagement with non-traditional partners and donors, including international financial institutions, regional banks, civil society and the private sector. The Sahel project which I talked about is one of these initiatives. These efforts have been strengthened by our regional resource mobilization advisors and regional and country offices. As a result, contributions from programme country governments have almost tripled  from $12 million in 2013 to $34 million in 2014. We welcome the favorable ratings of a number of major donor assessments, including MOPAN, which we believe reflects the improvements we have made in mobilization and alignment of resources and increasing value for money. On Thursday we will have another informal on UNFPAs Resource Mobilization Strategy, and I know that my colleagues look forward to engaging with you on these issues. As part of the broader discussions on UN fitness-for-purpose and QCPR implementation, UNFPA will continue to engage in discussions with Executive Board members and our partner UN agencies on funding of our respective strategic plans for 2014-2017 and the implications of the post-2015 agenda for the Funds and Programmes going forward. The exchange rate fluctuations and strong US dollar continue to pose challenges and it is clear that we cannot continue to do business as usual. We have already implemented and are currently in the process of exploring additional austerity measures.  Mr. President, In January I announced a set of organizational changes to facilitate our engagement with governments and the development of strategic partnerships, and to enhance our communication, resource mobilization and outreach. These changes took effect on April 1 and I am pleased to report that they are starting to pay off. Let me also welcome Arthur Erken as Director of the new Communication and Strategic Partnerships Division. This Division will strengthen UNFPAs work with partners, help us better tell our stories and advocate for our issues, and mobilize support from our traditional donors while tapping new sources of funding. Please join me in welcoming Kwabena Osei-Danquah as Director of the new Division for Governance and Multilateral Affairs. This Division will enhance UNFPAs partnership with Member States and the Executive Board and strengthen our collective work to advance the ICPD agenda in the new development era. Marcela Suazo is heading UNFPAs new corporate project on South-South cooperation, and I have called on Bruce Campbell to lead our work on data for development. We are fortunate to have Marcela and Bruces skills and political acumen to help us advance our work in these important areas going forward. Benoit Kalasa joins us at Headquarters as Director of the Technical Division. He brings his long field experience and deep technical expertise to the role. Mabingue Ngom has replaced Benoit as Regional Director for West and Central Africa. His extensive knowledge of the region will be a tremendous asset. Finally, Ramiz Alakbarov has taken over the reins as Director of Programme Division. I am confident that his considerable field experience in a wide range of countries will be an enormous asset to the organization in this new function. We are also in the process of recruiting new Directors for the Latin America and Caribbean Region as well as the Asia and Pacific Region. I believe the changes we are undertaking will make us more fit for purpose as we enter the post-2015 development arena. Were off to a good start. We anticipate that, at the end of the post-2015 process and discussions around the indicator and monitoring framework, the United Nations will have an agenda and a core set of priority indicators that might have implications for our Strategic Plan and its further implementation. We look forward to engaging the Board on the way forward in the coming months. This includes seeking your guidance on whether to proceed with the mid-term review of the current Strategic Plan as planned or whether to undertake a somewhat limited review based on technical assessments of implementation, while focusing on bigger substantive matters once the monitoring framework is complete. We also hope to engage other funds and programmes and Member States on possibilities for making country programmes more dynamic and responsive to changing development needs in the field. Within the Fund, we have established an internal working group of senior colleagues to suggest long-term measures to ensure that UNFPAs role is fully relevant in the new development agenda. The group will engage all staff before providing its conclusions for the consideration of the Executive Committee and the Executive Board. In partnership with you, our Executive Board members, we are building the UNFPA we need to build the future we want.  Mr. President, Ladies and gentlemen, This year, more than 59 million girls will turn 10 years of age. That's 59 million chances to do it right, to catalyze the dramatic transformations they  and we  so desperately need. If we get it right, in 2030 we wont be talking about reaching 99 percent of our strategic plan targets or deliberating over outputs and indicators. If we get it right, todays 59 million 10-year-old girls will be 25-year-olds living with their brothers in dignity, equality, health and well-being. If we get it right, we will be celebrating 59 million empowered, educated, employed young women, freely exercising their human rights, and driving economic growth and sustainable development in their countries and for the world. We have to get it right. And I am confident that we will. All of us at UNFPA look forward to working with you to create the future we want. Thank you."

These goals are designed to eliminate poverty, discrimination, abuse and preventable deaths, address environmental destruction, and usher in an era of development for all people, everywhere. The Sustainable Development Goals are ambitious, and they will require enormous efforts across countries, continents, industries and disciplines  but they are achievable. UNFPA is working with governments, partners and other UN agencies to directly tackle many of these goals  in particular Goal 3 on health, Goal 4 on education and Goal 5 on gender equality  and contributes in a variety of ways to achieving many of the rest.* Click on the icons above to see how UNFPA's work will help advance this bold vision for a better, healthier, more equitable and more sustainable future.

Nicolas Axelrod/Ruom for UNFPA 1 NO POVERTY  Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere   target=""_blank"">One in five peoplein developing countries live on less than $1.25 a day. Millions of others live on only slightly more, and are at risk of slipping back into extreme poverty. Poor health and lack of access to education both result from poverty and help perpetuate it. Conflicts and disasters also contribute to these dire circumstances, undermining social and economic stability.   UNFPA works with governments, other UN agencies and partners to improve access to sexual and reproductive health care in developing countries, where reproductive health problems are a href=""/sexual-reproductive-health"">leading cause of ill health and deathfor women and girls of childbearing age. Reproductive health care  which includes maternal health services and family planning enables women to protect their health and choose the number, timing and spacing of their children. This empowers them to study, work, and raise their families out of poverty.   UNFPA also works to eliminate harmful practices like href=""/node/362"">child marriage, which keep girls from school, and advocates for young peoples access to health care, skills development and jobs. Healthy, educated, employed and empowered young people improve not only their own prospects but the prospects of their community as well. Nations may realize a  href=""/node/8685"">demographic dividend  a boost in economic productivity  when there are growing numbers of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents.  UNFPA also responds to the reproductive health needs of people caught in emergencies. Together, these measures help some of the world's most vulnerable people realize their rights, maintain their health, seek opportunities and reach their full potential.

End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture The effects of hunger do not go away after a meal is served. Chronic poor nutrition has lasting effects, and can even extend into the next generation. Pregnant women who are nutritionally depleted may face complications in pregnancy, and can pass the ill-effects of hunger onto their future children. UNFPA trains and supports midwives, health workers and health systems that address the nutritional needs of pregnant women and girls. At antenatal visits, which are often a woman's first introduction to the health system, expectant mothers receiving counselling on proper nutrition. UNFPA-supported waiting homes also serve nutritious meals to pregnant women while they await delivery.

Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages  This goal calls for achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health care, reducing global maternal death rates, and ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Reproductive health problems are aleading cause of ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in developing countries.   Impoverished women suffer disproportionately from unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion, maternal death and disability, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and related problems. Young people are also extremely vulnerable, facing disproportionately highHIV rates as well as barriers to reproductive health information and care.   UNFPA is the lead UN agency in promoting sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, comprehensive sexuality education and maternal health services. UNFPA works with partners to strengthen health systems, including through the training of midwives, who  when properly trained  could avert href=""/node/9333"">two thirds of maternal and neonatal deaths. UNFPA also supports the integration of HIV-prevention and treatment programmes into sexual and reproductive health care, so it is as readily available as possible.

Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning  Some 103 million young people around the world lack basic literacy skills; more than 60 per cent of them are women. Additionally, research shows that a majority of young people lack sufficient knowledge about their sexual and reproductive health, leaving them vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancy and a host of other concerns.   UNFPA works with governments to promote href=""/gender-equality"">gender equality as well as investments in education and opportunities for young people. UNFPA also supports programmes that teach literacy, numeracy, human rights and life skills to vulnerable adolescent girls, and helps to develop and implement href=""/comprehensive-sexuality-education"">comprehensive sexuality education, which teaches young people about their bodies, health and disease prevention.  Equipping women and girls with the ability to choose the timing and number of their children also helps them stay in school.

Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls  Women are much more likely than men to be impoverished, deprived of education and opportunities, and victimized by sexual and domestic href=""/gender-based-violence"">violence. Goal 5 calls for the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls, the end of all forms of gender-based discrimination, and the elimination of harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM). It also calls for ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights.   UNFPA supports policies and programmes that promote gender equality at all levels  from villages and schools to whole countries. UNFPA also collaborates with partners around the world to eliminatechild marriage andFGM, practices that violate girls rights and perpetuate inequalities. And UNFPA works closely with partners  including men and boys themselves  to fight the global epidemic of href=""/node/364"">gender-based violence.   UNFPA leads the UNs efforts in promoting access to href=""/sexual-reproductive-health"">sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including through strengthening health systems, training href=""/midwifery"">midwives, improving education about sexual and reproductive health, and supporting health services in many of the most deprived places on earth.

Ensure access to water and sanitation for all  Each year, href=""http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/"" target=""_blank"">millions of people die  and many more are sickened  from diseases associated with poor water, sanitation and hygiene. These needs can be especially acute in emergencies, where the specific hygiene needs of women and girls are often overlooked.  UNFPA distributes 'dignity kits' in disaster- and conflict-affected communities. These kits contain menstrual pads, soap, underwear, and other essential supplies to help women and girls maintain their health, hygiene and sense of dignity, even under grave circumstances.

Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all  Around the world, young people are struggling under a lack of decent work opportunities and insufficient investments. Yet the potential of this generation of youth is unprecedented: There are more young people in the world than ever before. Coupled with declining fertility rates in many parts of the world, many developing countries have a rare opportunity to recognize a  href=""/node/8685"">demographic dividend  a boost in economic productivity that occurs when there are growing numbers of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents..  But to make the most of this opportunity, countries must encourage decent employment, invest in education, and ensure access to adequate nutrition and health services, including sexual and reproductive health care. UNFPA is working with partners, including civil society, communities and governments, to encourage policies that can help countries realize a demographic dividend.

Reduce inequality within and among countries Economic growth will not be sufcient to reduce poverty if it is not inclusive. Yet by some measures, inequality is growing, and there remain large disparities in peoples access to health and education services.  UNFPA works to reach marginalized people and communities, especially those who have been left behind by economic growth and development. This includes vulnerable women and girls, those living with disabilities and indigenous communities. UNFPAs efforts include extending health services to those out of reach, supporting programmes that promote gender equality, advocating for an end to gender-based discrimination and violence, and addressing the needs of vulnerable migrants.

Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable More than half the global population lives in cities, and the numbers of urban residents are only growing. Cities offer the promise of education, jobs, and health and social services, yet too many people are unable to access these benefits. Many urban residents live in slums and contend with extreme poverty and exclusion.  UNFPA works with partners to promote inclusive href=""/urbanization"">urbanization, including by improving access to health care and opportunities in urban slums. UNFPA also advocates for the welfare and sustainability of urbanizing communities, and helps gather data about their needs.

Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts  Climate change affects every country in the world  from extreme weather events and changing weather patterns to the rising sea level and disrupted national economies. These effects will only grow worse with time. Urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to mitigate and adapt to climate change's impacts.  UNFPA is working with governments to better understand how population dynamics affect the changing climate and how people can become resilience in the face of these changes. With partners, UNFPA has developed Demographic Exploration for Climate Adaptation (DECA), which helps policymakers see where vulnerable populations are and what hazards they might face. This information can form the basis of policies for planning more sustainable infrastructure and reducing disaster risks. UNFPA also helps address the humanitarian consequences of climate change.

Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies Justice and the rule of law are essential for development. Yet for too many people, justice is out of reach. This is especially true in emergency situations, where peoples vulnerability to violence  including sexual violence  increases. UNFPA helps to strengthen policies and services for survivors of violence. For instance, UNFPA works with police and judges in many countries to strengthen services for survivors of gender-based violence and to improve womens and girls access to justice.

NA,"press","18 September 2013","Opinion  Building Better Lives through a Population and Development Agenda 18 September 2013   Half a century ago, the world was warned of the imminent explosion of ""the population bomb."" There were fears that humanity would suffer mass starvation. And that societies would plunge into turmoil - because of overpopulation. At that time, Asia was considered to be at the core of the population problem. The average woman in Asia could expect to bear five children in her life time. The region's population was projected to double within 33 years. Many countries responded by embarking on programmes to control population growth. The landmark 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), attended by 179 governments, shifted the discourse on ""population control"" to people-centred development. The ICPD Programme of Action established, for the first time, inseparable linkages between population and development policies, with a clear focus on sexual and reproductive health from the standpoint of human rights - in particular the rights of women and families to decide freely whether and when to have children. The probability of every child surviving to adulthood was greatly increased. Families acquired better knowledge of sexual and reproductive health. Many more were given the means to make informed decisions about their fertility. The Asia-Pacific region can be proud of its successes: an average woman today has around two children instead of five. Life expectancy has increased dramatically. Fifty years ago, the average person could expect to live until the age of 45. Today a woman can expect to live to the age of 72 and a man to 68. Almost as many girls as boys enter primary school. But success comes with new challenges. The concern today is not just about population numbers. Rather, it is about the complex interlinkages between population and development. Putting people first to build better lives must remain the focus of efforts to address the population and development challenges that the Asia-Pacific region faces. Increased life expectancy and lower fertility rates have resulted in rapid population ageing in the region that is unprecedented in human history. Some countries are at risk of becoming old before they become rich. The population of older persons will triple by 2050 to reach 1.2 billion. In East Asia, one in three persons will be aged 60 or older. Furthermore, by 2050, there will only be 3.5 working persons to support one older person, as compared with 10 working persons today. There is thus an urgent need for the region to prepare for ageing societies. While the opportunity for the demographic dividend has passed in some countries, in others there is still an opportunity to harness its potential. In South Asia, around half of the population is still below the age of 25. With the appropriate mix of policies, including job-led growth and effective school-to-work transition, it will be possible to reap the youth dividend. On issues of sexual and reproductive health and rights, great strides have been made in strengthening policy. Yet programme implementation is lagging, particularly in targeting the most sexually active population group, namely youth. Lack of information concerning sexual and reproductive health and limited access to related services are contributing to unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions. These gaps are also exposing millions to the risk of HIV, in particular key populations at risk, including people who inject drugs, people who buy and sell sex, men who have sex with men and transgender people. This means that comprehensive sexuality education and increased access to a range of contraceptives must be made a priority. Furthermore, sexual and reproductive health programmes must also reach childless married women, unmarried women and girls, as also men and boys, as part of an integrated public health system that combines curative, preventive and health promotion services. Despite overall progress on maternal health, in some countries the number of women dying in childbirth still remains stubbornly high. There are parts of the region where one in 200 mothers dies giving birth. Asian and Pacific nations must do better in incorporating rights-based approaches to addressing population dynamics in their long-term plans for inclusive and sustainable development, including the impact of climate change. And most of all, the response to the region's challenges must be grounded in a commitment to addressing the unmet needs of women and all other groups that remain excluded from the development process. How do we collectively tackle these new and persistent challenges? That question will be answered at the Sixth Asian and Pacific Population Conference (APPC), which ESCAP is organizing with UNFPA this week in Bangkok. This Conference is part of, and will contribute to, the global ICPD 20-year review mandated by the United Nations. More than 400 representatives, including ministers, from over 45 countries and stakeholders from civil society will gather at this Conference. Meeting 50 years after the first APPC in 1963, they will seek fresh solutions to the region's population and development challenges. The outcome of the Conference will shape population and development policies for the future we want. As Asia-Pacific takes its place on the world stage, our governments have the means and the responsibility to build better lives for the region's 4.3 billion people. There is greater hope that the rapid population and development transformation will nurture the promise of a future that will be brighter than what had been predicted half a century ago. Dr. Noeleen Heyzer is Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

NA,"press","31 August 2015","    Speech  Statement by Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin Executive Director UNFPA 31 August 2015  EN  Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, Colleagues and friends, Ladies and gentlemen, Earlier this month, the international community took a huge step forward for people and the planet with a watershed agreement on the path ahead for prosperity and sustainable development over the next 15 years. In just a few weeks, world leaders will formally approve the 2030 Global Agenda for Sustainable Development at the United Nations Summit here in New York. This is truly a historic moment. As we celebrate this momentous achievement, the important work begins  how to translate this bold blueprint into bold action to transform the lives of individuals and the trajectory of nations. We at UNFPA are especially pleased that the post-2015 outcome document and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development reflect the conclusions of the ICPD Beyond 2014 review and reaffirm the Programme of Action's recognition that human beings must be at the center of sustainable development; that women, young people and vulnerable groups must receive priority attention; and that a human rights-based approach is key to ensuring no one is left behind. These principles are essential building blocks for a more inclusive, sustainable world. Critical aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals derive from the ICPD Program of Action: Goal 3, and its inclusion of universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services, maternal health, access to AIDS treatment and more; Goal 5, with targets on discrimination against women and girls, gender-based violence, harmful practices including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of course, universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. But beyond these two goals, issues central to the ICPD agenda and to UNFPA's mandate are embedded in and across the SDGs: In Goal 1, on ending poverty in all its forms everywhere; In Goal 4, which speaks to skills and education related to gender equality and human rights; In Goal 8, with references to youth employment, which we know is central to the whole concept of the demographic dividend; In Goal 10, which speaks broadly to addressing inequalities and discrimination, including for migrants; In Goal 11 on inclusive urbanization; In Goal 16 on promoting just, peaceful and inclusive societies, with its targets aimed at ensuring participation and safety from violence; In Goal 17, which calls for stronger data systems. It is clear that the ICPD remains as relevant as ever  a universal agenda that cuts across all aspects of sustainable development  and that UNFPA has a critical role to play in the future development space. We at UNFPA  and this Executive Board  know that you can't build the wellbeing of individuals, including their health and education, without each individual being free to exercise their rights. We know that you can't create equitable, inclusive societies by leaving half the population behind. We need the power of women and girls to drive development. We know that you can't build a better, prosperous future for people and the planet by ignoring the promise and the potential of young people. Young people are not a problem to be solved  they're a solution! Empowered, educated, employed young men and women exercising their human rights, engaged in decision making and in the economic and social life of their communities will spur inclusive economic growth and sustainable development. They are the true architects and builders of the future we want. I was particularly pleased to see reference to the demographic dividend in the post-2015 outcome document  the first time that has appeared in a UN outcome document. And I would like to commend the Board for your foresight in recognizing the importance of this concept at our last session. Investing in the power and potential of young people could not be more relevant as we enter the new development era. Further to this recognition by the Executive Board, we have begun our work in this area. As you know, we are already working with a number of Member States who have requested our support in order to harness the demographic dividend in their countries. This is clearly ahead of the implementation of the SDGs, and we intend to maintain that momentum. UNFPA is strengthening its efforts to ensure we have the tools to provide the support being requested by Member States  and called for by the SDGs. We are putting together evidence that can guide countries to make the right investments, throughout the life cycle,to generate the conditions necessary to seize the opportunity presented by their large youth populations and to actually reap the dividend. And we are partnering with key actors to garner the support  both technical and financial  to implement the right programmes where they are most needed. From the Sahel through all the other regions where we work, we are defining the targetedinvestments and interventions necessary to build on the potential of young people. Among the priority investments likely to empower adolescent girls and women are literacy, including comprehensive sexuality education, access to contraception services and information. These are central to realizing the dividend I would like to sincerely thank all donors who are contributing to our work on adolescents overall, and especially to our Action for Adolescent Girls Initiative and to the Global Programme to End Child Marriage. We are seeing tangible results, and this is something to be celebrated. In Niger, for example, adolescents who have participated in the programme are marrying later, and among married adolescents the contraceptive prevalence rate has increased from 18 to 34 percent. That in itself is going to give the adolescents who are married time to go back to school and be able to reach their potential. It also reduces maternal mortality because maternal mortality reduction occurs when we expose women to family planning  to the tune of almost 30 percent. I am sure that in partnership with Member States, and with critical partners like UNICEF and others, we will be able to address the first step of building human capital, which is to ensure that all adolescent girls are where they should be  in school  and that they have access to the services they need to be healthy. Indonesia also has a robust programme like this targeting adolescent girls and we have various programmes around the world addressing these issues in multiple locations. Last Friday's side event highlighted our work with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to ensure that the right investments are in place for girls, in a post-conflict context, to build the country's human capital, accelerate its demographic transition and enable it to reap the social and economic benefits of the demographic dividend. Such investments are also critical for building resilience and peace in a post-conflict context. We were joined by very senior members of the Government of DRC and that in my view shows the political commitment and will of the government to make change happen. All too often, today's young people are depicted as a threat to peace and security, prone to indoctrination, easy prey for militant extremists. But the truth is the vast majority of young people do not engage in violence, even in conflict settings. The truth is that millions of young people contribute directly to the rebuilding and resilience of their communities, working for tolerance and against exclusion. The truth is that young men and women can be peace builders and must be acknowledged as such. Just over a week ago I had the privilege of representing the Secretary-General in Amman at the Global Forum on Youth, Peace and Security and saw this promise firsthand in the young men and women I met. I'm told that we had young people from 110 countries represented at that meeting. So there is a groundswell amongst young people to participate in peacebuilding. Young people like Victor Ochen from Uganda  a child of conflict who chose the path of peace, working to heal trauma and promote youth leadership. Victor and the African Youth Initiative Network he founded have been nominated for the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize. With the determination of young people like Victor, we can build resilience and lasting peace. With the leadership of young women like Fatima Abdi Ali, a UNFPA Y-Peer fellow and youth activist in Somalia, we can build more inclusive, equitable and just societies. With the optimism and out-of-the-box thinking of young innovators around the globe, we can turn swords into startups! Just last month, UNFPA brought young coders from around the world to Kampala, Uganda, to develop mobile application solutions that promote young people's access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. This is building on the work we have already done with our partners in the US to build an app to increase access to sexual and reproductive health information and services in Ecuador and Nigeria. #HackForYouth paired students and youth leaders with technology experts for a three-day coding spree. Together, they developed creative solutions to a range of challenges: from the reporting of sexual harassment to reaching rural first-time mothers with maternal health information to addressing young people's confidentiality concerns while accessing sexual and reproductive health care. The winning app was a quiz that dispels myths and provides accurate information about sexual and reproductive health. By playing the game, users earn points towards free mobile airtime. The hackathon, sponsored by UNFPA's Innovation Fund, and supported by our partners and donors, reflects our growing commitment to leveraging information and communication technologies to empower young people so they can be change agents for the health and wealth of society. We plan, over the coming days and months, to continue to build on all of these initiatives and engage within the organization and with Member States and other partners, including CSOs, on the implications of the Post-2015 outcomes for UNFPA's work, including its focus areas, programming, partnerships and resourcing. We also expect to contribute fully to discussions on the most supportive monitoring, review and follow up mechanisms for the Post-2015 agenda, from the vantage point of our universal, cross-cutting mandate. Humanitarian situation Mr. President, Let me turn now to the humanitarian situation in the world. In 2014 alone, nearly 60 million people were forcibly displaced by conflict, war and persecution  the largest number since the United Nations was created 70 years ago out of the ashes of the Second World War. Every day we see stories of migrants and refugees escaping violence, discrimination, disaster, massed at often unwelcoming borders, risking their lives in leaky boats on deadly seas for the chance of a better, safer life. Like so many of the challenges the world faces, this is a universal problem requiring a collective, coherent response. Because it is more and more clear that we're all in the same boat. And there is no quick fix. We need to solve the problems that have led to this. Last year saw more than 400 natural disasters. And the frequency and severity of such disasters will likely continue to increase due to the effects of climate change. The international community has never been more challenged. And when we went to the meeting on disaster risk reduction in Sendai it became evident that this is one of the things we will have to confront as we go forward in the post-2015 development space. UNFPA is doing its best to respond to these increasing humanitarian crises. We have made significant investment in our internal capacity to be on the ground, on time, and to deliver critical life-saving interventions to those most affected, especially women, adolescent girls and young people. And now with the Sustainable Development Goals, we have a universal agenda to leave no one behind and build resilience. For UNFPA this means ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. It means ensuring protection from gender-based violence and empowering women and young people in all settings, particularly those who are affected by crises and disasters who are often the hardest to reach. It means ensuring safe birth everywhere, even under the harshest conditions. To take just one example, a UNFPA clinic in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan has supported the safe delivery of nearly 4,000 babies to date without the loss of a mother. No maternal deaths. Doctors, nurses and midwives perform deliveries around the clock, and also provide a full suite of prenatal and post-natal care services. So it is possible. If we can do it in crisis, we can do it in places where there is no crisis. Maternal mortality can actually be a thing of the past if we put our minds to it. In today's complex crises, there are growing demands. Addressing sexual violence in the context of humanitarian crises will be among the issues discussed at a meeting on ending violence against women, convened by UN Women and UNFPA and hosted by the Government of Trkiye, in Istanbul in December this year. In all humanitarian crises, UNFPA is working with partners to strengthen capacity and resilience, supporting local and national actors in immediate response and long-term recovery. We are actively engaged in the lead-up to the World Humanitarian Summit next year to ensure that humanitarian action becomes more effective, and reinforces achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and also to make sure there is no distance between development and humanitarian response. As I have mentioned in previous Executive Board sessions, given the new post-2015 landscape, UNFPA has commissioned an independent review analyzing humanitarian trends as they relate to UNFPA's mandate. The aim is to spark discussion within UNFPA around its strategic focus over the next 15 years, and we look forward to engaging with the Board on these issues moving forward. The assessment recommends that UNFPA use the forthcoming mid-term review of the strategic plan in 2016 to align with the SDGs and include a broader humanitarian strategy with a more robust results framework. I hope you will join us today at 1:15 in Conference Room 1 to discuss UNFPA humanitarian action post-2015. Staff security One area where we have made sustained progress over the past five years is in the safety and security of our personnel. We are equipping humanitarian surge staff with the skills needed to work in high-risk duty stations and have made significant improvements in emergency preparedness and response. Unfortunately, in recent months we have had to relocate some international staff for security reasons, and many national staff and their families have been forced to leave their homes for safe areas. But despite these challenges, our staff continue to deliver on our mandate with dedication, professionalism and passion. And I'd like to take this time to commend UNFPA staff for their service, even in the face of these unprecedented challenges and danger. One of the groups that we look to and we celebrate is our staff in Yemen, and I would like to congratulate Lene Christiansen and her team as an example of the tremendous dedication of UNFPA staff. Despite the enormous challenges facing the team in Sana'a, they continue to work with national counterparts to reach the most affected populations and ensure that the needs of women and girls are not forgotten during the ongoing crisis. Operating in very high-risk duty stations also comes with a high price, including significant costs to implement mitigating measures. We are integrating these direct security costs into new programmes and will seek donors' support accordingly. Staff also pay a high price in such situations and we are working with our UN partners to strengthen our capacity to provide needed psychosocial support during and after their exposure. Staff changes UNFPA staff are indeed our greatest asset. And for the past three years, we at UNFPA, and I personally, have been privileged to work with a truly outstanding leader  Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen. AB has been a tremendous asset to UNFPA and an exceptionally supportive and dedicated Deputy to me, leading many of the reforms and advances we have made to steer the organization in the right direction. I know Board members and UNFPA colleagues join me in wishing her all the best as she takes up her new role as CEO of Plan International in London. I will miss her wise counsel, support, and unparalleled drive and her considerable contributions towards making UNFPA and the UN fit for purpose. The recruitment process is currently under way for her replacement, and we hope to be able to conclude this process shortly and share the results with you soon. We will also be saying goodbye in the coming months to another long-serving member of the UNFPA family, Mohamed Abdel-Ahad, Regional Director for the Arab States, after 22 years of dedicated service to the organization. Mohamed has represented us in unique circumstances  in Palestine, in Iran and Myanmar, and he did it with distinction. Now, he is managing probably the most challenging and dynamic of our regions, and he's done that with such great distinction. So I would like you to join me in thanking Mohamed for what he has done. As we say goodbye to Anne-Birgitte and Mohamed, let us welcome Yoriko Yasukawa, as the new Regional Director for the Asia and Pacific region. Yoriko brings over 30 years of experience within the UN system and strong leadership skills that I am confident will be a huge asset to our work in the region. Enterprise Risk Management/Audit Mr. President, I know the Executive Board has always been concerned with oversight and accountability, so I am pleased to report that UNFPA launched its Enterprise Risk Management strategy in June and that 12 top corporate risk areas have been identified, along with the risk owners, operating with the guidance and oversight of the Executive Committee of UNFPA. All UNFPA business units are currently undertaking online risk assessments, which will be followed by the development of mitigation strategies. UNFPA leadership will discuss and approve an updated ERM strategy annually each June to ensure continued relevance over time. I am also happy to report that UNFPA received an unqualified audit report from the UN Board of Auditors, which recognized satisfactory progress on the implementation of their recommendations. We are also encouraged by UNFPA's Office of Audit and Investigation Services draft report on the follow-up review of our efforts to address issues raised in the 2013 audit of the Global and Regional Programme. The draft report, to which we are currently replying, indicates that in the design and first year of implementation of the Global and Regional Interventions 2014-17, the GRP successor, UNFPA made progress, in varying degree, in addressing the issues raised previously. We will continue to pursue these efforts in the coming years of implementation of the GRI. Let me also say we have made good progress in strengthening the evaluation function and are happy to present the quadrennial budgeted evaluation plan for the period 2016-2019 during this board session. We welcome your continued strong support and your endorsement of the plan, which sets out a wide range of evaluation approaches to meet our needs and the necessary investments in order to implement the plan. Financial situation/resource mobilization Mr. President, I have spoken about our human resources, so let me now turn to our financial resources. The sustainability of resources is critical to our ability to keep pace with the growing demands for our services in the countries we serve. It is key to fully integrating the ICPD agenda into national development strategies and frameworks and to supporting countries in achieving the internationally agreed development goals and advancing the post-2015 sustainable development agenda. We are extremely grateful to Member States for your continued strong political and financial support. That said, unfortunately we project a sharp decrease in our resources in 2015, to a large extent exacerbated by unfavourable exchange rates for a number of major currencies against the US dollar. As reported in the Updated Integrated Resource Plan for 2014-2017 that we have submitted for your consideration, this year we introduced a series of austerity measures on all of the Integrated Budget components in order to align spending and remain financially sustainable. As a result, the updated use of resources reflects reduced spending plans, in line with available income. This will undoubtedly and unfortunately have consequences for our ability to support programmes in the countries we serve. Needless to say, we continue to work with our partners to overcome these challenges and hopefully reverse these trends as we go forth. The good news is that our donor base remains strong, with 102 donors as of 1 August 2015, of which 26 have given multi-year commitments to core resources. Within the context of the sustainable development goals, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the UN Fit-for-Purpose process and the evolving financial landscape, and at your request, UNFPA has developed a comprehensive and integrated resource mobilization strategy. The new strategy emphasizes the unwavering commitment of the Fund to exploring all avenues to raise the necessary resources, with a strong focus on the delivery of development results by the whole organization. We are also working with Member States to emphasize that domestic resources will become a major plank for the work that we do, and we are pursuing this aggressively in many parts of the world. I was recently in Turkmenistan talking to the Government, and I believe that we shall sign a co-financing agreement with them very soon. The presentation on the new Resource Mobilization Strategy and Funding Commitments report will take place later today, and we look forward to an engaging and open dialogue as we work together to address the important goal of increasing core resources and achieving a stable, predictable and diversified resource base for UNFPA. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Before I finish, there is an issue that I must draw your attention to. As we have said many times, family planning is a human right. And yet, an estimated 225 million women around the world who want to avoid pregnancy do not have access to effective modern contraception! This is an absolutely staggering figure, mind-boggling in this day and age, when in point of fact what we need per woman around the world to meet this need is less than $20. Since 2007, UNFPA's Global Programme to Enhance Reproductive Health Commodity Security  the only United Nations programme specifically focused on delivering family planning and reproductive health commodity security, including in humanitarian situations  has helped address this injustice. Contraceptives procured by the Global Programme have saved 774,000 lives and potentially averted an estimated 47 million unintended pregnancies and 18 million abortions. Because of its impact on the ground, the Global Programme is critical to meet the unmet needs of an additional 120 million women  the goal set at the London Summit in 2012. Yet today millions of poor women around the world face the risk that these family planning and contraceptive services may not be available, wiping out progress that has been made and stopping us from reaching those hardest to reach. As I said, when you expose women universally to family planning, you can actually reduce maternal mortality by 30%. The Programme now faces a serious financial gap of approximately $1 billion over the next five years. This means that 1 million mothers and newborns could die; it means 80 million unintended pregnancies if we don't act. Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, Let me appeal to you and your governments  as key partners in shaping the new development agenda  to please support the Global Programme and, through it, save the lives of millions of women and girls around the world. I have received strong personal support from UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on this matter, and I will continue to work with him in urging more and more governments to pledge their support to the Programme. This includes active participation in a Pledging Meeting, to be hosted by the Government of the Netherlands in The Hague on 3 November 2015. Together with Mr. Ban, I urge your Governments to participate in this important event and take the opportunity to announce commitments to the Global Programme. Now is the time to do so. The Sustainable Development Goals  notably targets 3.7 and 5.6  call on all of us to take action to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. We believe in these rights. All of us say it is the right thing to do. So let us put resources behind these rights. Millions of women and girls around the world count on us. We  the international community  cannot let them down. We have a moral obligation to do whatever we can. Their lives depend on it. I thank you very much.   "
NA,"press","23 October 2017","    Speech  Statement at the Global Symposium on Ageing, Seoul 2017 23 October 2017   Statement of UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem at the opening session of theGlobal Symposium on Ageing 2017 in Seoul, Republic of Korea.  Mr. Tim Thompson, Asia Pacific Population Institute (APPI), Mr. Sukyeong Hwang, Commissioner of Statistics Korea (KOSTAT), Honorable Deputy Minister Mehseni Bandpey of Iran, Members of Parliament, Colleagues and friends from academia, civils society organizations and sister UN agencies, As the newly-appointed Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, it is my great pleasure to open this Global Symposium on Ageing. UNFPA is proud to co-host this meeting with the National Statistical Office of the Republic of Korea, KOSTAT. I would like to express my gratitude to the Government of the Republic of Korea, and the leadership of KOSTAT, for their support and cooperation, most notably Mr. Sukyeong Hwang, KOSTATs Commissioner. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the age of ageing. One in nine persons is aged 60 or older. This is projected to increase to one in five by 2050. Population ageing is no longer a phenomenon of developed countries. The pace of population ageing is progressing most quickly in developing countries. By 2050, around 80 percent of people aged 60 or older will live in what are now low- or middle-income countries. Ageing is a triumph of development. We must now turn our focus from merely helping people reach old age to helping them reach a happy old age. Ageing is not only driven by falling fertility rates, but also by an unparalleled rise in longevity. It is the outcome of great achievements in health and nutrition, in social and economic development, and it reflects a better quality of life around the globe. Yet from surveys we know that more and more countries have major concerns about population ageing and the related issue of low fertility. Let me assure you that UNFPA does not take these concerns lightly. Consider the example of Mrs. Kim  now entering her seventh decade of life in the small village where she was born and raised. Imagine her, as with so many of her generation, being made to marry early in those days, perhaps as young as 15 or 16, with minimum education. She would probably have had children early; the pregnancies would likely have been unplanned; and childbirth may have been risky. Her husband, 10 or even 20 years her senior, may have died a long while ago, leaving her a widow, unprepared to enter the workforce and unable to properly fend for herself. This story is not uncommon; we see it repeated in many places, in many contexts. As people live longer even as family sizes become smaller, we can all be concerned about the sustainability of social security and intergenerational support systems. As a growing proportion of older people rely on pensions, there is fear that this will exhaust government budgets, undermining economic growth. There is concern that in old age existing inequality will be exacerbated. Elderly men have higher incomes than women, because they had higher lifetime earnings. This is of particular importance because the older population is, and will remain, predominantly female. As women outlive men, we are seeing more women in old age left in poverty. Further, the rural elderly are compelled to work for longer than their urban peers. They dont have generous retirement schemes. Health problems and limitations are more common and more serious among older people  especially those who are rural and poor. In times of conflict or disaster, when people must flee, what happens to that old woman or man who cant run? Disability or limited mobility are often a feature of old age. Do public disaster response plans at present cater for their circumstances? Our health systems need to adapt to the changing burden of disease of an older society. Lets innovate with new areas of specialization, and new points of access. Inevitably, we will need long-term care systems that are geared to more, and older, people. Ideally, we will need people at home, socially attached for as long as possible. Also ideally, when it comes to health care settings, the new model of nursing home is not going to be a traditional nursing home; it will be a community setting with gardens, energy, happiness and disability-friendly spaces. Last, there is such concern over low fertility that we see a growing number of incentives to encourage people to have more children  incentives that too often do not reflect the rights and needs of young couples, incentives that are not particularly effective. Fear of the unknown is a human trait. But if history teaches us one lesson, it is that the unknown is often less worrying once it arrives. The future is often transformed by factors we cannot anticipate, not least by human ingenuity  and I encourage all of us to overcome the fear of ageing, and to capitalize on gatherings like this to develop innovative solutions. It is not the sheer number of people who are in working age that determines economic growth, but the productivity of those who are economically active. In our unequal world today, far too many people are not engaged in economic activity  too many are left behind, or engaged in informal work. So addressing inequality is one of our best paths to a better future in ageing societies. Let us return for a moment to the story of Mrs. Kim. Imagine if, as an adolescent, she had been able to take that other branch of the road: Completing school and higher education; achieving gainful employment; marrying as an adult and of her own choice; having healthy children and being able to invest resources for their well-being; and, ultimately, enjoying a secure old age. Let us therefore ensure that all people are able to contribute. At the same time, of course, many people can and do earn income from labour or assets well into old age, successfully supporting themselves and contributing to their communities. A more inclusive society, with rising productivity, can offset a decline in the proportion of the working age population as we define it today. And we must not underestimate this fact. If addressed in a holistic way, ageing may ultimately lead to better policies, more participation of those left behind, more resilient social systems and allow us to harness the experience and energy of older persons later in life  to reap what we call the longevity dividend which can be considered a second demographic dividend of healthy, active ageing with engagement in family and community. A longevity dividend comes with an older generation that has enjoyed the opportunity to save and invest during their active working years. This is more likely to come from a generation of youth that has enjoyed human rights throughout the life course Who entered the labour market with a sound education and had access to decent work Who started a family free from coercion or violence And who lived a life where family and work were in harmony, with men sharing responsibility for child care and household chores, in an equal partnership. What is important is ensuring that both women and men have the chance to balance work and family life. Gender equality in the home, as well as in the workplace, is critical. OECD shared compelling data last week that couples who share housework on a more gender-equal basis are more likely to have a second child. So countries that fear very low fertility should focus on gender equality and creating a more fair and just world for all. To advance a better world in an ageing society, we need evidence-based policies that help us create a society for all ages, as called for by the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing. A world that is focused on justice for all ages, for men and women, and that is supportive of work-life balance. This underscores many of the values of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population on Development or ICPD, as well as the 2030 Agenda which is underpinned by the Sustainable Development Goals. The ICPD, which has long served as the foundation for UNFPAs mandate, gives special attention to enabling the self-reliance of older persons, securing their ability to work as long as possible and desired, and enabling their continued participation for the benefit of society. As the United Nations population agency, many countries are increasingly turning to us for advice and assistance on issues of ageing and low fertility. Let me clearly underscore that UNFPA is committed to helping governments address these issues in concert with partners, civil society and communities. To this end, UNFPA has launched a Global Programme on Ageing to support governments to generate the best possible national data on population projections, ageing and fertility. And we are proud to say that the Programme benefits from the generous support of the Republic of Korea. Between 1974 and 1991, UNFPA collaborated closely with the Republic of Korea in the area of family planning, population policy, and population data, and we are very gratified to now partner with Korea to offer demographic intelligence and policy support to other countries. The issue of population ageing is of immense importance to nations such as Japan, China and Iran, as well as European and Latin American countries. Its soon to become of interest to Africa as well. Ageing is indeed part of a universal agenda. Building on this foundation, I am truly pleased to announce that UNFPA will establish a permanent liaison office in Seoul  and we look forward to welcoming other partners to our shared work on population ageing. The Republic of Korea, and many other countries, have rich experiences to share with one another. This event is an opportunity to do exactly that  to convene us all as stakeholders, and to garner lessons for a better world. Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues and friends  from the elders of Guatemala we are told: Everyone is the age of their heart! Everyone is the age of their heart. I believe that by joining forces and working together, we truly can make a difference and help promote meaningful responses to population ageing  responses based on values of non-discrimination and equality that advance the vision of a vigorous, happy and healthy old age. It has been a genuine pleasure to witness the close collaboration between KOSTAT and UNFPA over the past few months. I applaud the staff of both institutions for making this event happen. I would also like to thank the Asia Pacific Population Institute, APPI, for its superb collaboration  and to thank all of you for committing your time and expertise to these deliberations, which will have an impact on the well-being and happiness of elders around the world for years to come.

NA,"press","12 August 2015","    Statement  Investing in the Power of Young People, Transforming our World 12 August 2015  EN ES AR  Statement of the UNFPA Executive Director for International Youth Day Today, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, commemorates International Youth Day, under the theme, Youth Civic Engagement, by celebrating the actions young people around the world take to improve their well-being and that of their communities. In 65 countries, more than half the population is younger than 24. Denying these young people the right to meaningful participation in decision-making is a gross violation of their human rights and a failure of the democratic process. It is also a waste of human capital that can propel nations towards development. Young people are driving change towards a better future for all in every corner of the world. They are leading global action on climate change, campaigning to end discrimination, speaking out to uphold democracy and the freedom of speech, connecting our world with innovations in information technology, and building peace in societies ravaged by war. In a world of increasing conflict, young people must be our strongest partners if peace and security are to win out over war. We need their fullest capability and broadest engagement for people, the planet and prosperity to flourish. The next 15 years offer a unique opportunity for a demographic dividend that will accelerate conflict-recovery and sustainable economic growth and development in many countries if we empower, support, educate and create employment for young people today. Young women and men need protection from violence, and they have a right to access essential education and health services, including for their sexual and reproductive health. They also have the right to be at the tables where decisions and peace are made. Yet, for the most part, young people remain excluded from decision-making processes. Although 16 per cent of the worlds population is 20-29 years old, this age group represents only 1.6 per cent of parliamentarians, most of whom are men. Young people rarely join political parties, and the majority do not vote in elections. It is misleading, however, to conclude that young people are uninterested or simply do not care. Todays young people are better educated and volunteer more for causes than previous generations. They are also a key driving force behind making companies, organizations and governments more socially and environmentally conscious. To fully participate in the lives of their communities, young people need to overcome multiple legal, social and cultural barriers and discrimination. Adolescent girls, in particular, are often burdened by child marriage, sexual violence, unplanned pregnancies and HIV, preventing their full civic engagement. In September, world leaders will formally adopt Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a historic, transformative, inclusive, universal agenda for our people and the planet. To have any chance of succeeding in building a better future for humanity, we must remove the obstacles confronted by young people and invest in their health, well-being, education and livelihoods to unleash and leverage their full potential as global citizens. We must ensure that all young people have access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, including comprehensive sexuality education. UNFPA is proud to work with networks of adolescents and youth to mobilize support for the United Nations Secretary-Generals Global Strategy for Womens, Childrens and Adolescents Health. Our efforts to promote youth leadership and participation enable young people to develop the skills, knowledge and support needed to make informed decisions about their bodies, lives, families, communities, countries and the world.Together, we can ensure that the post-2015 development agenda promotes the human rights, health and well-being of the largest generation of young people in history. Together, working in partnership with young people, we can enable them to survive, thrive and transform our world, and deliver a better future for all of us.   "
NA,"news","14 November 2013","News  Experts call for Youth Empowerment, Sexual and Reproductive Health     14 November 2013   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia  UNFPA participated today in two key sessions on youth empowerment and adolescent pregnancy at the third International Conference on Family Planning, under way in Addis Ababa from 12-15 November. One of the largest gatherings in the area of sexual and reproductive health, the conference is calling attention to the wide-ranging benefits of family planning to make the world a better place for women, children and youth. At the plenary session Building the Future: the Young and the Restless, panellists emphasized the need to promote the leadership of more than 1.8 billion young people around the world  the next generation of leaders  and to rework the design and implementation of sexual and reproductive services targeting youth. Most importantly, the sociocultural barriers that prevent adolescent girls and young women from accessing sexual and reproductive health need to be addressed. We need to put sex back into the family planning agenda, said Kate Gilmore, UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Programme), adding that leaders should get out of their discomfort zones on sexual and reproductive health issues and confront the reality. The smart thing to do to protect young people from sexually transmitted infections, early marriage, and teenage pregnancy to facilitate a safe passage into adulthood, she said. Ms. Gilmore also noted that sexual and reproductive health is a multisectoral issue, and underlined the urgent need to push for adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health and rights in the future development agenda. Mr. Tewodros Melesse, Director General of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, highlighted that young people should have a leadership role in the provision of sexual and reproductive health services. He underscored that education should empower young people and serve as the framework for countries to reap the benefits of the demographic dividend. The session focused on the need to put in place innovative strategies for sexual and reproductive health programmes, to improve work through youth-to-youth sexuality education, and proactively engage boys and men in the process. Mentorship programmes were cited as a key component in building life skills for adolescent girls and young women. No Motherhood in Childhood A concurrent session on adolescent pregnancy organized by UNFPA,  Girlhood, Not Motherhood  , took up the issue of adolescent pregnancy. Speaking on the subject, Dr. Nema Keita, Minister of Health of Guinea Conakry, noted that we are sitting on a powder keg and we dont know when it is going to explode. Dr. Keita indicated that the medical services in his country were not tailored to deal with the challenge, but that the government is currently working with partners like UNFPA to provide youth friendly sexual and reproductive health services. He also talked about the necessity to incorporate comprehensive sexual education in schools. Dr. Kebede Worku, Minister of Health of Ethiopia, highlighted the need for a multisectoral approach to address adolescent pregnancy. In this context, he spoke about Ethiopias efforts to ensure gender equality in school enrolment, develop a legal framework to prevent child marriage, and address deep-rooted practices that prevent young women from accessing sexual and reproductive health services. Dr. Worku also noted that there is a need to inform men about sexuality so that they learn to care for young girls and their safe transition to adulthood. The participants were joined by two young activists, Leopoldina Manjatefrom from Mozambique and William Otuck from Tanzania, who shared their stories of resilience and courage, and discussed their work helping adolescent girls and young women access sexual and reproductive health services. It is high time that we discussed sex openly, said Ms. Gilmore, at the heart of this lies the health of the youth who are our future."
NA,"press","14 November 2019","Press Release  Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 ends with a clear path forward to transform the world for women and girls 14 November 2019   NAIROBI, Kenya, 14 November 2019 - The Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 concluded today in the Kenyan capital, with partners making bold commitments to transform the world by ending all maternal deaths, unmet need for family planning and gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls by 2030. The Nairobi Summit represents a renewed, re-energized vision and community working together to act and deliver. Together, we will make the next ten years a decade of action and results for women and girls, keeping their rights and choices at the centre of everything we do, said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. The Summit, co-convened by the governments of Kenya and Denmark with UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, unveiled critical new data about the cost of achieving these goals. It mobilized more than 1,200 commitments from around the world, including billions of dollars in pledges from public and private sector partners. It also raised the voices of marginalized communities, youth and grassroots advocates, who were able to directly engage heads of state and policymakers about how to realize the rights and health of all people. ""The Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 was a massive success,"" said Director-General of the Kenya National Council for Population and Development Dr. Josephine Kibaru-Mbae. ""But it was only a start. We leave Nairobi with a clear roadmap of actions we must all take to advance the ICPD agenda and transform the world for women and girls."" The Summit opened with the release of new research showing the price tag to achieve three transformative results -- zero maternal deaths, zero unmet need for family planning, and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices -- within the next decade. The total cost to the world would be $264 billion, according to the analysis by UNFPA and the Johns Hopkins University, in collaboration with Victoria University, the University of Washington and Avenir Health. Summit attendees then stepped up with specific and concrete commitments to help the world reach these ambitious, but achievable, goals. Pledges were made by governments, civil society, youth groups, faith-based organizations, academia and many more. Governments including Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, together with the European Commission, committed around $1 billion in support. The private sector also stepped in: Childrens Investment Fund (CIF), The Ford Foundation, Johnson & Johnson, Philips, World Vision and many other organizations announced that they will mobilize some $8 billion in combined new pledges. There will be no ICPD50. Women and girls around the world have waited long enough to have rights and choices, said Ambassador Ib Petersen, Denmarks Special Envoy for ICPD25. Looking towards 2030, we now enter a decade of delivery during which we will walk the talk and hold all of us to account for the commitments we made in Nairobi. Over 8,300 delegates from about 170 countries* took part in this radically inclusive conference, uniting behind the Nairobi Statement, which establishes a shared agenda to complete the ICPD Programme of Action. The same way the original 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo was a turning point for the future of women and girls, the Nairobi Summit will be remembered as a watershed moment that set in motion actions that saved lives, lifted millions of women and girls, their families and communities from exclusion and marginalization, and enabled nations to harness the demographic dividend to grow their economies.

UNFPA/Helene Christensen  The history of the partnership between UNFPA and the Government of Italy has included support to adolescents and womens empowerment programmes, maternal health interventions, prevention and treatment of gender-based violence including female genital mutilation, as well as census data collection efforts and humanitarian responses. Since 1980, the promotion of sexual and reproductive health and rights and the protection of women and girls have guided collaborative efforts between UNFPA and Italy. Initiatives that help communities develop economically and nurture resilience to deal with natural disasters and conflicts are critical to the Italian aid focus. Accordingly, collaboration with UNFPA on family planning and reproductive rights, which can lead to a demographic dividend as more young people are employed society, is a central mutual objective. In 2017, the Italian Government committed 1.4 million to UNFPAs core budget, which allows for flexibility in programming to meet changing needs. Addition funding of nearly 6 million has been provided for initiatives in Afghanistan, Mozambique and Yemen, with discussions underway for additional support to programmes in priority countries Italian support to womens empowerment and gender equality rests comfortably within its overarching approach to sustainable development through investments in human, economic, social and environmental programmes. Through this continued collaboration, UNFPA will be positioned to work closely with communities across the world to help achieve our shared goals for women and girls."

I would like to express my gratitude to the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea for initiating and organizing this conference, and to the OECD and the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs for their partnership in this endeavor. We are an agency with eyes, ears and feet on the ground in more than 150 countries, and let me assure you that low fertility and population ageing are growing concerns around the world. If we work together on these issues, we can help countries address their concerns in a coherent and integrated manner, and I welcome this meeting as a first step in this direction. The transition towards lower fertility rates and ageing societies is no longer an issue of developed countries only, and the sooner other countries anticipate these trends the better. Falling fertility rates are a by-product of sustainable development, as they reflect declining mortality rates, gains in healthy life expectancy, greater participation of women in the labour market, and broader access to health and family planning. In turn, declining fertility rates alter the age structure of populations. With average fertility rates dropping below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman, we see an increasing share of older persons in a growing number of countries. Recognizing these demographic transitions as an opportunity and not as a threat is paramount, and falling fertility levels do not necessarily stand in the way of a second demographic dividend. If well addressed, ageing and low fertility may lead to better policies: from effective prioritization of vulnerable groups and fully harnessing the experience and energy of elderly persons to developing more inclusive communities. Now, more than before, reducing lifelong inequities will be our best bet for development. And in delivering this, the issues that UNFPA stands for will be critical: sexual and reproductive health and rights and ensuring that each young persons potential is fulfilled are key in ensuring a productive workforce that effectively offsets a shrinking workforce. Capitalizing on the creative potential of all persons must be the guiding mission for ensuring innovation where low fertility prevails. This challenges us to collectively consider whether lifes opportunities are shared with all people in society, or whether some are indeed left behind. One of the most challenging questions that low fertility has prompted is with regard to the role of women in society. Womens participation in the labour force has both boosted economic growth, but is also questioned as a possible reason for declining fertility. This question deserves careful research. Some of the best evidence shows that womens labour force participation is not directly linked to fertility in consistent ways. Where womens work is highly insecure, career advancement does not accommodate family life, and child care is weak  womens labour force participation is more likely to lead to lower fertility. But in economies where women have greater job security and career progression, along with excellent family benefits and child care  womens greater participation in the labour force does not necessarily lead to lower fertility. This is a valuable area of analysis, and UNFPA would welcome the opportunity to work on these issues with many of the experts here today. Finally, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994  which was endorsed by more than 170 Member States  offers clear vision and values on many of these issues. On the rights of women, the ICPD is clear that all persons, including women and girls, have rights equal to those of men, in terms of education, access to training, equal pay for equal work, and the right to decent work. With regard to reproductive rights, the ICPD underscores the singular importance of ensuring the right of women and men to decide freely the number, timing and spacing of their children. Incentives and disincentives constitute a violation of those rights. If countries want to lift fertility levels, it should be done through a deeper understanding of the work-life policies that may ease the double burden of home and career. This is possibly unique in each country, but there seem to be some universal truths. Creating a world where productive life and reproductive life are in harmony  is the goal of UNFPA. More and more countries are looking to UNFPA for support in responding to low fertility and population aging. Let me assure you that we hear these concerns and that UNFPA is committed to supporting countries in addressing them. To this end, we are expanding our Global Programme on Ageing. The Republic of Korea is already contributing to the Global Programme, and we would like to invite others, including Japan, to join our efforts. The Republic of Korea has made investing in health, including family planning; education; and womens empowerment top priorities, and it is an important partner for UNFPA in promoting coherent, integrated responses to population ageing. Building on this foundation, UNFPA will establish a permanent liaison office in Seoul, to explore mutual opportunities for research, knowledge sharing and technical cooperation on issues of interest. UNFPA looks forward to supporting these efforts, and to leveraging its global presence, network and convening power to broker and support regional and global cooperation. Many countries look to the organizations and countries assembled here for guidance. The Republic of Korea and Japan, together with UNFPA, the OECD and its Member States, have a wealth of experience and knowledge. Let us join forces to extract and share lessons and good practices, and help countries face the future with confidence. Thank you.   "
NA,"updates","02 Apr 2019","Updates  Kenya, Denmark and UNFPA rally partners for action on ICPD 02 Apr 2019   Nairobi Summit co-host Denmark will continue to show support for ICPD in any way possible, said Minister of Development Cooperation Ulla Trns at a side event during the 52nd Session of the Commission on Population and Development.  UNFPA/Usenabasi Esiet  Kenya and Denmark, co-conveners of this years Nairobi Summit on ICPD25: Accelerating the Promise, joined UNFPA to mobilize political support and galvanize partnerships in preparation for the conference, in a side event following the openingof the 52nd session of the Commission on Population and Development. The Nairobi Summit, to be held on 12-14 November 2019, marks 25 years since the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo adopted its landmark Programme of Action, centred around the recognition that sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and womens empowerment are essential to achieving sustainable development. Chaired by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem, yesterdays side event offered a forum for United Nations, government and civil society partners to discuss key achievements and lessons learned during the 25 years since Cairo  and to articulate their concerns and goals for the summit, which seeks to accelerate the implementation of the Programme of Action in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals.  The buck stops with the government, said Josephine Kibaru-Mbae, Director General of the National Council for Population and Development of Nairobi Summit co-host Kenya  emphasizing the strategic leadership needed to drive the ICPD agenda forward.  UNFPA/Usenabasi Esiet Its what we do on a daily basis that matters Reflecting on the past 25 years, Josephine Kibaru-Mbae, Director General of Kenyas National Council for Population and Development, ascribed her countrys progress in elevating the well-being and dignity of its people to the patient work of implementation. Its not rocket science, she said. Its what we do on a daily basis that matters. Looking forward, she emphasized Kenyas plans to expand policies, programmes and domestic financing for sexual and reproductive health, as part of the drive towards universal health care and a decent life for all people  and alongside interventions to support youth and fulfil the countrys potential for a demographic dividend. Our fight today is their future Ulla Trns, Denmarks Minister of Development Cooperation, remarked that the millions of people left behind by the progress made since Cairo still depend on our leadership to improve their chances of a brighter and better future. She affirmed her countrys commitment to accelerating the ICPD agenda, including through financial resources. This year, Denmark has set aside DKK 715 (about US$ 107 million) for sexual and reproductive health and rights, more than ever before. This includes support for innovative projects like UNFPAs new programme to provide comprehensive sexuality education for out-of-school youth in West Africa. Stressing the importance of partnerships with governments, civil society, the private sector, academia and youth-led organizations, Ms. Trns also noted the need to seek new partners, reaching beyond those already convinced  a sentiment echoed by several members of the audience. I know we can find common ground, despite our differences, if we choose the right conversations, she said, for the sake of women and girls globally.  This was one of those moments when you saw history unfolding, said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem about the 1994 conference in Cairo, which she attended as a young professional. This is what well recreate now.  UNFPA/Usenabasi Esiet She concluded by characterizing the realization of the ICPD Programme of Action as both an obligation to young people, whose future is at stake, and an opportunity for everyone. Unlocking the potential of women and girls, she said, unlocks resources that benefit society as a whole. All hands on deck As the global custodian of the ICPD, said Dr. Kanem in her statement, UNFPA will convene governments, civil society and other partners  including young people  in a series of events and activities in the months leading up to the Nairobi Summit. She invited new and existing partners to co-create the Summit as an inclusive dialogue that generates concrete commitments  and keeps the focus on those whose sexual and reproductive rights remain unrealized.  We will be listening directly to the voices of women, girls, young people  anyone whos been left behind, said Dr. Kanem. And theyre going to tell us that its time to deliver on that promise that was made 25 years ago, and that we renewed this morning."
NA,"news","12 April 2016","News  Census reaches vulnerable women and girls in a remote area of Myanmar for the very first time     12 April 2016   UNITED NATIONS, New York/Shan State, Myanmar  When people are not counted, they are excluded, said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, yesterday during the opening session of the 49thCommission on Population and Development (CPD). Data and analysis are critical to ending inequalities, reaching the people who are hardest to reach and a life of dignity for all. For that reason, nationalcensuses, which are ideally undertaken every 10 years, are one of a governments most critical duties and an essential tool for achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Without them, policymakers cant understand disparities, their citizens health and development needs and where or how to invest in everything from schools to health care to roads. However, censuses are also costly, requiring huge amounts of time and man power, and are among the most complicated peacetime processes nations undertake. As a result, many countries have outdated or inaccurate information  especially regarding their most vulnerable populations, such as women and girls and internally displaced persons. Myanmar hadn't completed a national census since 1983 when it embarked on conducting one in 2014, with support from UNFPA. And the people in the northern, non-government-controlled region known as the Wa Self-Administered Division had never been officially counted at all.  Half of the population in the Wa Self-Administered Division is below the age of 21.  UNFPA Myanmar/Yenny Gamming No one knew how many people lived in the division, how many had access to education or clean water, the rates of maternal or infant mortality and much more. The 2030 Agenda is built on the assumption that every country will be able to identify and locate the most vulnerable groups, but over 109 countries in the world today dont have vital statistics and registration, said UNFPA Executive Director, Dr. BabatundeOsotimehin, during the CPD session. We still need to develop better ways to reach those who have historically gone uncounted. Counting the uncounted Myanmar is among the least-developed countries in Asia, and in a 2000 WHO ranking of world health systems, it came in second to last globally. It is also an incredibly diverse country, with at least 135 distinct ethic groups, some of whom, especially in more remote border regions, remain embroiled in conflict. The Wa, traditionally found along the border between Myanmar and China, are among those remote groups. In 2013, in advance of the census, UNFPA supported an initiative to reach out to local authorities in the Wa Self-Administered Division and other non-government-controlled areas to build trust in the census and those conducting it. As a result, in the spring of 2014, the census enumerators successfully made their rounds in the Wa Self-Administered Division. They found that the division had a population of 470,764, and that in a nation with a literacy rate of 92.6 per cent among men and 86.9 per cent among women, only 25 per cent of men and 20 per cent of women in the Wa Self-Administered Division were literate. In addition, only 30 per cent of people were able to access running water and toilets.  Authorities in the Wa Self-Administered Division learned how to interpret and use the census data in workshops.  UNFPA Myanmar/Yenny Gamming But with over 50 per cent of residents below the age of 21, the population was also found to be younger than the national average, meaning it could potentially receive an economic boost through a demographic dividend, if improved educational and sexual and reproductive health services are established. Using data to spur development and peace And the census not only facilitated the development process in the division, but also the peace process. Townships and villages throughout the Wa Self-Administered Division opened dialogues and agreed to collaborate with neighbouring settlements with whom they had long been in conflict in order to complete the census. Then this year, outreach workers hosted workshops in the division, as part of a UNFPA-supported initiative to provide local authorities across the country with the tools to understand the census data and how it can improve policy that launched in September. As a result, participating civil society members from throughout the Wa Self-Administered Division grew increasingly accustomed to working with each other and representatives from government departments. And many left eager to start working to use the new data to shape policies and priorities for their districts, towns and villages. As a woman, I am concerned that illiteracy is higher among women than among men, said Yex Ahng, a representative from the Wa Traditional Culture Association, who attended the workshop. In this way, understanding the census data motivates me to advocate for more girls to attend school. "
NA,"press","13 August 2013","Press Release  Latin America, Caribbean Conference on Population, Development Opens on International Youth Day 13 August 2013   *WATCH LIVE  HERE  * MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay The First session of the Regional Conference on Population and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean opened here on Monday, with representatives from more than 30 Latin American and Caribbean countries, who will discuss a regional population and development agenda beyond 2014. The opening ceremony of the four-day conference was presided over by Uruguays President Jos Mujica; the nations Foreign Minister, Luis Almagro; Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), Alicia Brcena; Executive Director of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin; and Ibero-American Secretary-General, Enrique V. Iglesias. In his address, Dr. Osotimehin said the conference was being held in the context of two major United Nations undertakings: the ICPD Beyond 2014 Review and discussions on the post-2015 development agenda. He considered the gathering an opportunity to link the ICPD review with post-MDG discussions to ensure that we are truly able to put people and rights at the centre of the development agenda beyond 2015. Today, people in Latin America and the Caribbean are more empowered than they were 20 years ago, continued the UNFPA Executive Director. The region has seen considerable economic growth over the past decade, and social protection programmes in many countries are ensuring that more people, including the poor and disenfranchised, are benefiting from this growth. Similarly, he went on, we have seen important progress in gender equality and in womens participation in the social, economic and political spheres. But much work remains in order to achieve full gender equality, increase the capacity of women to exercise their sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, reduce gender-based violence, improve the balance between womens productive and reproductive lives, and in so doing, increase their ability to participate much more fully in the economy, in political processes and in public life. However, Dr. Osotimehin emphasized, Promoting gender equality in a post-2015 world includes finishing the work of the Millennium Declaration. Unfortunately, the MDGs that are most off-track are those directly linked to achieving gender equality, such as reducing maternal death and ensuring universal reproductive health and rights. This is despite overwhelming evidence that gender inequality significantly slows economic growth in both rich and poor countries. Focusing on the critical question of growth and speaking on the occasion of International Youth Day, Dr Osotimehin underscored the essential role of young people. Several countries are poised to reap the demographic dividend, he said. But this requires that decision-makers and planners invest now in programmes to improve young peoples access to decent work, education, social participation and health services, particularly sexual and reproductive health services. Fully engaged, educated, healthy and productive adolescents and youth can help break the cycle of poverty and strengthen their families, communities and nations, said Dr. Osotimehin. For this to happen, he added, young people must be able to exercise their right to education, including age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education; their right to sexual and reproductive health, through youth-friendly health services that include access to contraception; their right to decent jobs and to participate in decision-making. The outcome of this conference should send a clear message to the 140 million young people living in the region that we are listening to them and that we want to join forces to provide opportunities for those among their ranks who do not have access to school or work, he urged. Working together, we can mount an integrated response for the up to 32 per cent of young people in the region suffering the consequences of school dropout, adolescent pregnancy, unemployment, drug addiction, or conflict with the law, the Executive Director added, declaring: This is a moral obligation and a social, economic and political necessity. The conference, one of the largest intergovernmental meetings in recent years, is attended by more than 800 people, including authorities, population experts and representatives from non-governmental organizations. It is organized by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the Uruguayan Government, with the support of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund.

NA,"press","22 September 2014","    Speech  Special Session of the UN General Assembly on the Follow-up to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development 22 September 2014    Statement of Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin Executive Director, UNFPA Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank the President of the General Assembly for his opening remarks and for giving me the opportunity to address you on this special occasion. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his unwavering support for the ICPD Programme of Action and the ICPD Beyond 2014 review and for his reports on the review. Many have contributed to bringing us to this auspicious moment and I would like to thank your Governments, Excellencies, for your commitment and support and the progress made in your countries to improve peoples lives. As in Cairo, civil society was critical to the success of the ICPD review and I want to express our gratitude for their dedication and support. Mr. President, In 1992, the world rallied around the concept of sustainable development at the Earth Summit in Rio. Central to this new concept was the principle that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development. In Cairo just two years later, the ICPD Programme of Action defined this principle in real terms and forever changed how we perceive population and development. It shifted the focus from human numbers to human lives, human well-being and human rights. Cairo ensured that a bedrock principle of development would be to realize dignity and human rights for all people as a means of achieving our collective goals. Over the past 20 years, we have seen the rise of hundreds of millions out of poverty, gender parity in primary education, fewer women dying giving life and more women in the workforce. These advances show just how powerful development founded on dignity and human rights can be. But we still have a long way to go. Our world is growing increasingly unequal, and all too often women and girls get the short end of the stick. The pace of climate change and environmental degradation shows that we cannot sustain a system in which those at the top continue to draw more and more of our finite resources. Until we can deliver for all people equitably, and enable all people to reach their potential, we cannot achieve sustainable development. Excellencies, The right to health is incontrovertible and this Assembly has adopted numerous resolutions on the importance of ensuring the highest attainable standard of health for all. Sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are universal human rights. They are also central to sustainability, gender equality and the empowerment of women. But for many, the right to sexual and reproductive health is still not a reality. Not for the 10-year-old child bride forced to marry a 62 year old man and bear his children before her mind and body are ready Not for the adolescent girl who, lacking the information and services to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, resorts to unsafe abortion Not for the poor rural woman facing a difficult birth without a skilled attendant and far from the nearest health facility... Not for tens of thousands of young people who lack the means and the knowledge to protect themselves from HIV or other sexually transmitted infections Not for those affected by crises and conflicts, which often put women and girls at risk of sexual violence and limit their access to safe spaces, services and support. And the consequence can be a death sentence: 800 women die every day from pregnancy related causes, many of them adolescent girls. And for every maternal death, 20 more women and girls endure preventable complications, including obstetric fistula. Whether a woman is rich or poor should not determine whether she lives or dies. To achieve universal access to sexual and reproductive health and ensure reproductive rights for all, we must bolster fragile health systems so that we can reach women and girls with the services and commodities they need where they live. It is simply unacceptable that today more than 200 million women who want family planning cannot get it. Mr. President, Since Cairo, we have made substantial progress in the area of gender equality and womens empowerment. Yet, in no part of the world is gender equality fully realized and in some places, existing gains are being rolled back. More women are in the workplace, but often in vulnerable and informal employment. Women continue to be underrepresented in positions of power and decision-making. Gender parity in secondary and tertiary education is yet to be achieved. One out of every three women in the world, in every country and from every background, will experience physical or sexual violence in her lifetime. Too many are not safe at school, not safe fetching water, not safe on a university campus, not even on the steps of a courthouse or in their own homes. Discrimination and harmful traditional practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation persist, and the perpetrators operate with impunity, even in the face of laws against such practices. Each days news brings home to us this reality in vivid detail. Another brutal gang rape, another battered woman, another girl dead from an utterly honourless killing, another young person lost to an unsafe abortion or to AIDS, another school empty. Sexual violence on an epic scale as a weapon of war, a tactic of terror Is there a tipping point? When will we finally say enough to violence and discrimination against women and girls? When will we finally bring back our girls  all our girls and women  to school, to the workforce, to their rightful place alongside men and boys at the table where decisions are made, and away from child marriage, away from early pregnancy, away from HIV infection, away from violence and harmful practices that strip them of their dignity and in the worst cases deprive them of their lives? Only then will we be able to build the future we all want. We cannot advance by leaving half of the population  our women and girls  behind. Mr. President, Excellencies, We now have the largest generation of young people the world has ever seen. There can be no talk of sustainable development without adequate investments in their in their health, education and employment, without empowering them, equipping them with skills, agency and resilience. Declining fertility rates are providing low- and middle-income countries with a window of opportunity to realize a demographic dividend, yet many young people are excluded from development efforts. Today 40% of the worlds unemployed are young people, and 60% of all young people in developing regions are without work, not studying, or engaged in irregular employment. What little data we have on the state of young peoples sexual and reproductive health and access to services and information show major concerns. Over 8.7 million unsafe abortions occurred among 15-24 year olds in developing countries in 2008, and 41 percent of all new HIV infections occurred in this same age group in 2009. You hold the future of the worlds young people in your hands. Invest in them because they hold the worlds future in theirs. We also need to ensure that older persons have access to social protection systems, health care and lifelong learning opportunities. As our societies age, we can reap a second demographic dividend by providing opportunities to older people to live their lives to the fullest. They say 70 is the new 40 so we need to engage them and use them effectively. This morning the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples opened in this hall. UNFPA will continue to work closely with Member States to help them meet the commitments they made during the regional ICPD review conferences to their indigenous populations so that they, like everyone else, enjoy their full human rights. Mr. President, Sustainability is about meeting the needs and aspirations of todays population while planning and making policy for tomorrows. In no field is this more evident than population and development. We must turn population trends into opportunities -- from youth bulge to youth bonus, from urban overload to vibrant, efficient urban centres, from internal displacement and refugee crises to making migration work for development. By supporting peoples rights and empowerment, by understanding population dynamics as they unfold, and by governing effectively and inclusively, we can realize these opportunities. We face perhaps no greater challenge over the long term than climate change. Tomorrow, the Secretary-General will host a Climate Summit to build momentum towards a global agreement and to make the case for action on the ground. The ICPD review shows us we need to fundamentally change our patterns of consumption to slow the frenetic waste of natural resources and enrich prospects for dignity and equality for current and future generations. Investing in universal public services is one of the most effective and just actions governments can take to create a foundation for equality and resource efficiency. As the debates and policies on population before the ICPD in 1994 demonstrated, large-scale global fears have too often overshadowed the human rights and freedoms of individuals and communities, and at worst have been used to justify constraints on human rights. The 20-year review of implementation of the ICPD agenda has shown us that we must empower people to determine the course of their lives, to generate the innovations that will address climate change and other challenges, and to devise the policies that will advance us collectively into sustainability. Our predecessors in Cairo understood this when they recognized that people are at the centre of sustainable development. Over the past 20 years, we have seen power of people time and again. The power of women able to decide by choice, not chance, whether and when to have children, and how many The power of young people  equipped with education, skills and opportunities  to contribute to and benefit from development. The power of adolescent girls who challenge the status quo, against all odds, and resist early marriage, early motherhood and female genital mutilation, and instead embrace education and the opportunities it can bring The power of women pushing for change in their families, their communities, and their legislatures The power of men  husbands and fathers  pushing to educate their girls... The power of older people in societies that respect and value their contributions. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, We cannot talk about sustainable development without ensuring that young peoples needs are met, that we give voice to their aspirations, that we include them in decision-making. We cannot talk about sustainable development without addressing womens empowerment, gender inequality, and discrimination and violence. We cannot talk about sustainable development without ensuring the sexual and reproductive health and rights of all. These issues must be at the heart of the Post-2015 agenda to ensure that current and future generations are made up of resilient, adaptive, innovative, creative people capable of building resilient societies. If we can do that, we will be able to address any challenge that our world faces, today and tomorrow. Thank you.      "
NA,"news","10 March 2016","News  Honour roll: Child brides return to school in Niger   Aichatou, who was married at 15 and widowed at 16, writes on the blackboard during French class.  UNFPA Niger/Souleymane Saddi Mazou  10 March 2016   NIAMEY, Niger  When Fati was 12-years old, her father removed her from school in Niamey and sent her to Nigeria to marry a 40-year-old man. A year later, she was hospitalized with injuries inflicted by her new husband. It took several months before she was well enough for discharge, and while she was still in the hospital recovering, her husband divorced her. By that time, she was the mother of a small boy. Aichatou had to leave school at age 15 after she was forced to marry a 30-year-old man. At age 16, shortly after giving birth to her first child, she was widowed. Finding themselves newly single, new mothers and not yet 18, both Fati and Aichatou went to live with family in the Talladj area of Niamey, where they spent their days caring for their babies and doing housework  with few prospects for the future, other than more of the same. Then two years ago, a knock on their doors changed both their lives.  Aichatou and her son.  UNFPA Niger/Souleymane Saddi Mazou An outreach worker was going door to door to spread the word about the UNFPA-supported Safe Space programme Illimin, which had recently launched in their area, and to find girls ages 10 to 19 who were not enrolled in school to ask if they would like to join the programme. Fati and Aichatou both said yes. By attending the Safe Space programme Illimin, I found the motivation to return to school, says Fati, unable to suppress a large smile. It helped me to gain confidence in myself. It has also re-awakened my lifelong dream to study and have a career. A dream that was shattered by my father. The price of denying girls an education Fatis and Aichatous stories of forced marriage are common in Niger  which, at 75 per cent, has the worlds highest rate of child marriageand, at 10 per cent, one of its lowest rates of girls enrolled in secondary school. This landlocked nation of 20 million is also one of the worlds poorest countries, and in 2014, ranked 188 out of 188 countries in the UNs Human Development Index. Investing in adolescent girls education and empowerment could prove key to strengthening the labour force and sparking economic growth in Niger  and in lower-income countries around the world. However, child brides and adolescent mothers are much less likely to attend school than other girls, meaning before countries can tap into the transformative potential of the 600 million adolescent girls on the planet today, they must reduce rates of both. Illimin means knowledge for dignity in Hausa, a common language in Niger, and the Safe Space programme Illimin was designed to combat both early marriage and pregnancy by educating and empowering adolescent girls to facilitate this change themselves. It is at the Safe Space that my dream to go to school came back to me, says Aichatou. In this program, I was welcomed, re-motivated and guided towards resuming my studies. Back to school In secure spaces chosen in consultation with communities, Safe Space staff educates girls about sexual and reproductive health, self-esteem, their rights, money management, public speaking and literacy. In 2014 and 2015, over 10,000 girls completed the program. Today, Safe Spaces have opened around the country, and 16,000 girls are scheduled to graduate this August alone. The programme plans to double that number for the class of 2017.  Fati is now enrolled in eleventh grade  and at the top of her class.  UNFPA Niger/Souleymane Saddi Mazou So far, at least 56 students have refused to marry men before age 18, despite pressure from their families, and credit the Safe Space with giving them the skills and confidence to negotiate the postponement. And many girls who were forced to drop out of school early are returning to class. Fati and Aichatou were part of the inaugural 2014 class. Today, they are enrolled in eleventh grade at a second chance secondary school for students who previously dropped out  and are ranked near the top of their class. Six days a week, they rise early to complete their homework and housework, then leave their sons with family, so they can spend the afternoon at school. These girls work well and are very involved in their education. I am sure they will succeed, says Ibrahim Hassane, their French teacher. After graduation, both girls plan to continue their studies. Fati hopes to enroll at the National School of Administration and Magistracy, and Aichatou dreams of becoming a journalist. Fati has also begun to campaign nationally  and internationally  to end child marriage, and has spoken at conferences in Zambia and Paris. ""I salute the determination of Fati and Aichatou,"" said Monique Clesca, the UNFPA representative in Niger. It is the Fatis and Aichatous of Niger who will help the country achieve its demographic dividend, because they have education and will participate fully in the life of their country. Ultimately, that's the result of empowering girls."" Souleymane Saddi Mazou   "

Significant progress has been made over the past 13 years in meeting the targets the international community set for social and economic development by 2015. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of government planning agencies, U.N. entities, global aid organizations, international foundations and civil society groups, half a billion fewer people now live in extreme poverty, four out of five children routinely get vaccinated for a variety of diseases, and deaths from malaria have fallen by one quarter. However, it's clear that come 2015, the world's report card on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be scored ""Incomplete."" And that's not just because we are likely to fail to meet some of the targets we set for ourselves in the early days of the new century. (We have fallen short on our goals on maternal health and family planning, for example.) We will also get an ""Incomplete"" because we are now facing challenges, like climate change, whose significance we failed to appreciate when the original goals were drafted.Family planning programmes have helped slow population growth, contributing, in particular, to a significant reduction in fertility in the developing world. Maternal death has been reduced, and we are now saving the lives of about 3 million children every year who previously would have died from childhood illnesses. We are also providing primary education for a record number of boys and girls in the developing world. With that in mind, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon appointed a U.N. System Task Team on the Post-2015 U.N. Development Agenda to facilitate consultation with stakeholders ranging from member states to civil society, academia and individual citizens. As part of their work, the Task Team produced discussion documents proposing basic principles for a new development framework. It's clear that come 2015, the world's report card on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be scored ""Incomplete."" The Secretary-General also appointed a High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons to outline a new set of goals designed to complete the work of the original MDGs and address the new challenges of the century ahead. The Secretary-General's vision for the new development framework centres on ending poverty through sustainable development, dealing with the problem of global climate change, and reducing inequality -- between men and women, and between rich and poor. The authors of this article, one of us the president of a developing nation and the other the head of the U.N. Population Fund, believe that Africa will be the test case for the world's resolve and success, or failure, to achieve these goals. This isn't a case of parochialism, though we both happen to be African. It is, instead, our shared judgment that Africa is likely to become the litmus test for whether the global community will have the resolve to work cooperatively to tackle the big issues that will affect us all on our increasingly interconnected and interdependent planet. Consider this. The world has added approximately a billion people since the United Nations drafted the Millennium Development Goals, and is expected to add approximately 3.7 billion more by 2100. Significantly, U.N. experts predict that almost all of that future growth will take place in developing nations, and that a disproportionate share of it will take place in sub-Saharan Africa. With this population growth will come increased demand for food, energy and water; increased pressure on the natural environment; increased demand for medical care; and an increased need for education and jobs. In addition, the effects of climate change are expected to hit sub-Saharan Africa particularly hard, exacerbating all of the challenges above. But the flipside of challenge is opportunity, and the opportunities in Africa are abundant. The 54 countries of Africa comprise, collectively, about 1 billion consumers with an average age of just under 20. This will represent an enormous market for the world's goods and services in the decades ahead. By mid-century, Africans will also represent one quarter of the global labor force, and by the end of the century, Africa will have the world's highest ratio of working age population to dependents. This is a giant potential ""demographic dividend"" that Africa can build upon. With far-sightedness, African countries can also tap the enormous potential of African women and girls. Educating women, providing age-appropriate sex education and access to family planning methods, will free and empower women and girls to make even more significant contributions to Africa's economic development. In many ways, the ""face"" of Africa's future is the face of a teenage girl. Africa's economy will also continue to benefit from the continent's enormous mineral wealth, which, if managed sustainably and equitably, should fuel accelerated economic growth in the decades ahead. The continent's potential for growth is also underscored by the fact that Africa has the world's largest share of underutilized arable land and water. The opportunities are extraordinary, the challenges many. As the United Nations drafts a new set of goals to follow the MDGs, Africa will be the ultimate testing ground for new strategies to end poverty, mitigate the impact of climate change and reduce inequality in the 21st century. However, if Africa gets it ""right,"" the continent will also be the new century's greatest success story. Read the story on CNN.com"
NA,"press","29 April 2022","Speech  High-Level Forum on Advancing Equity for People of African Descent 29 April 2022   Speech by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem at the High-Level Forum on Advancing Equity for People of African Descent in Accra, Ghana, 22 April 2022.  Your Excellency the Vice President of the Republic of Ghana, Dr. Mahamadu Bawumia, Your Excellency the Vice President of the Republic of Costa Rica, Epsy Campbell, Members of Parliament and the Diplomatic Corps, Distinguished Guests, Partners and Friends, It is a privilege to address you today as leader of UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, and as a champion of people of African descent. The theme of this high-level forum has a special resonance for me as a member of Africas sixth region  the diverse and dynamic African diaspora. From the Americas to the Pacific, from Asia to Europe and beyond, we form a living testament to human resilience and to the force of will to freedom. As the wise Akan elders have said: kuntum hwiyan, ek nakyi. When you escape the trap, home beckons you. Gathering here in Accra, as Africans and Afro descendants, we are reminded of our unbreakable bond. We share the same roots, the same present and a common future to which each and every one of us must contribute for all of us to flourish. We have an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen cooperation for our collective progress and to promote equity, healing and social justice for our communities across the globe. I am hopeful, because the wind is in our sails. Last August, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a unanimous resolution to establish a Permanent Forum of People of African Descent, and on August 31, 2021, we celebrated the first International Day for People of African Descent. We have seen wide-ranging efforts to accelerate the recognition, justice and development of our people, as the International Decade for People of African Descent calls on us to do. Today, we are signaling our undivided commitment toward building a stronger future for Africa and the diaspora, one based on our common ancestry, values, and goals. We are here to share lessons learned, forge new partnerships and co-create pathways for transformative change. I am grateful to the Government of Costa Rica and to the Vice President in particular, for bringing attention to issues affecting people of African descent and for calling for stronger collaboration with African governments to realize the aspirations of the diaspora community. In that connection, I commend the President of Ghana for establishing, as part of his office, a unit for diaspora affairs, encouraging Africans and the diaspora to forge even stronger bonds. Ghana has been a longtime supporter of the African diaspora, successfully hosting in 2019 the Year of Return, a historic initiative that commemorated the resilience of people of African descent and saw Ghanaians welcome the diaspora with open arms. That same year, a group of Afro-descendant parliamentarians met with Ghanaian parliamentarians and explored socio-economic opportunities between Africa and the diaspora  laying the groundwork for the stronger links envisioned in Agenda 2063. Indeed, Africa could benefit from facilitating cultural, economic, educational and scientific exchange with the diaspora, which in turn could bring significant development gains. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) could also provide an important mechanism to explore and promote mutually beneficial partnerships, business and trade. With its youthful population, it is important for Africa to invest in the health and education of young people and create the space for them to participate in all sectors of its economy. Building bridges with the diaspora can help Africas youth connect to new opportunities and drive growth. Across the continent, UNFPA is supporting governments in their quest to achieve a demographic dividend and is generating the data, evidence and policy frameworks for countries to realize it. Through censuses, surveys, monitoring and evaluation, innovative data platforms, research and reports, UNFPA contributes to bringing the unseen to light. In our latest State of World Population report, we delve into the neglected crisis of unintended pregnancy. Each year, 121 million pregnancies are unintended  a development and human rights issue of global concern. Such reports help lift the cloak of invisibility off the shoulders of those most vulnerable to discrimination and inequality. They also build a body of evidence that helps government leaders and policymakers pinpoint solutions for those at risk of being left out or left behind. UNFPA will continue to work to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the most vulnerable, particularly women and young people, are protected, and that they have equal access to health, including sexual and reproductive health. All of this is critical to making progress against the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and, ultimately, achieving the Africa We Want. Distinguished guests, There is a Ghanaian proverb: Fawodhodie ene obre na enam Total freedom, emancipation, and independence come with responsibilities. As we live life in larger freedom, let us heed our responsibilities to one another and make good on our collective promise to leave no one behind. This means lifting up and empowering people of African descent, and other historically marginalized people, now and in the future. Let us channel our shared culture, talents and legacy of resilience towards collective prosperity and progress. As always for Africa and the diaspora, in unity and solidarity lies our strength. Thank you."
NA,"news","09 December 2019","News  In Mauritania, imams take to radio waves to say child marriage is against Islam   At the radio station in Selibabi, Mauritania.  World Bank/Vincent Tremeau  09 December 2019   SELIBABI, Mauritania ""I refused to marry off my daughter for a simple, good reason: I want my daughter to be empowered, said Lemeima mint El Hadrami, 49. ""I don't want her to go through the same difficulties I did when I was young."" Ms. El Hadramiwas married when she was only 13. As is often the case for child brides, she became pregnant in adolescence and was forced to drop out of school. She had two daughters, both following difficult pregnancies. Then her husband left them. ""Back then, people didn't know that child marriage was harmful to a girl's health. It was a common practice for us,"" she recalled. Ms. El Hadrami is from Selibabi in southeastern Mauritania, a country where 37 per cent of girls are married off by age 18. Ms. El Hadrami (centre) with her daughters and sister.  World Bank/Vincent TremeauEnding child marriage in Mauritania and other countries in the Sahel, where the median age women and girlsmarry is 16.6,calls for a change in societys unwritten rules governing the practice. This means getting buy-in from religious and community leaders on a whole host of related issues, including gender discrimination and ending gender-based violence. An immature girl cannot bear a child UNFPA is working with partners to help raise awareness of the cascading harms caused by child marriage  from school discontinuation to higher maternal health risks and poorer long-term outcomes for girls and their families. An immature girl cannot bear a child because she herself is still a child whose body is not ready to carry a baby, said Telmidy, the imam of the Kuba Mosque in Selibabi, Stressing that many adolescent girls in his communities have died for that reason alone. Telmidy is one of 200 religious and community leaders mobilized across Mauritania by the Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) project, a collaboration between UNFPA and others, to show that child marriage is in fact haram, or forbidden by Islam. Early marriage is a complex issue and we have addressed it in a manner that respects Islam, he said. Islam protects the dignity of men and women. Telmidy and his fellow imams want to be agents of change. We discuss and share our knowledge of Islam and our experience by going door to door or during Friday prayers and people are starting to understand and respond.   I was really moved by the messages on the radio The SWEDD project is financed by the World Bank and implemented by the governments of Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cte dIvoire, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, with technical support from UNFPA. In addition to working with religious leaders, the project shares messages on girls empowerment through a popular radio programme. I was really moved by the messages on the radio, Ms. El Hadrami said. I do not want my daughter to experience the same difficulties that I did. I would like her to go as far as possible in her studies, to have a good job  a job that will allow her to enjoy a decent standard of living. She could become a minister, a doctor or a midwife. The radio messages work in concert with the faith-based outreach efforts. Imam Telmidy raises awareness about the dangers of child marriage to women.  World Bank/Vincent TremeauThe recommendations and guidelines broadcast on the radio are very important, especially because they are supported by religious beliefs, said Telmidy. People must listen to the radio to be informed. Some people are wedded to traditional customs The imams have reached around 370,000 people in rural Mauritania with training sessions on the dangers of child marriage. UNFPA is also helping the national network of Islamic scholars to learn about sexual and reproductive health issues, including not only related child marriage concerns, but also the benefits of birth spacing, and the importance of ending gender-based violence and female genital mutilation. Islam is a religion that honours human beings. Any action that harms an individual's physical or mental health is therefore forbidden, said Hademine Saleck Ely, an imam from the Central Mosque of Nouakchott. But some people are wedded to traditional practices and do not understand the danger of these customs. Telmidy pointed out that acquiring knowledge is compulsory for all Muslims: The Qur'an shows that a father has a responsibility to educate his daughters and protect them, and that he must delay their marriage until they turn 18... He must also allow them to earn a living, that is their right."" We must assume our responsibilities and fulfill our mission to share our knowledge with the community, he added.

NA,"press","25 January 2018","    Speech  Statement of Executive Director to the First Regular Session of the Executive Board 2018 25 January 2018   Mr. President,Distinguished Members of the Executive Board,Colleagues and friends, Good morning! And a very happy new year to everyone. Let me begin by again extending my congratulations to you, Ambassador Koonjul, on your election as President of the Executive Board. I would also like to welcome the rest of the Bureau, Ambassador Chull-joo Park of the Republic of Korea, Ambassador Besiana Kadare of Albania, Mr. Tumasie Blair of Antigua and Barbuda, and Mr. Dominique Favre of Switzerland. We at UNFPA look forward to working very closely with all of you over the course of the next year. Let me also take this occasion to thank Ambassador Ib Petersen of Denmark and the outgoing Bureau for your partnership, guidance and support throughout 2017, and for accompanying UNFPA, along with the diplomatic community, the United Nations Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General, and all of our other UN partners, as we paid tribute to and laid to rest our late Executive Director, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin. Mr. President, As you said, I have the privilege of addressing a formal session of the Executive Board as Executive Director for the first time. I would like to sincerely thank all Board members for the support extended to me since my appointment in October, and during my tenure as Acting Executive Director for the preceding four months. 2017 was quite a year. It was a year marked by challenges and change, by formidable opposition but also by opportunity. Yet, throughout the turmoil and transitions of 2017, UNFPA staff stood together, showed their mettle and continued to deliver impressive results for the women and girls we serve. I could not be more proud to serve as their Executive Director. Through it all, our strength and resolve were bolstered by the partnership, mutual trust and confidence that we share with the Board. Yes, we faced significant headwinds and funding challenges. Yet, we also saw a huge upsurge of support for UNFPA and for the rights of women and adolescent girls to control their bodies and their lives. We saw women march in the streets in every part of the world. Civil society and governments responded with new global movements like She Decides. More men joined the movement for gender equality through initiatives like He for She, and reinvigorated UNFPA-supported youth groups made their voices heard. Millions of women and men, young and old, in more than 80 countries, raised their voices in a resounding chorus of #MeToos, sharing on social media their stories of sexual violence and harassment, underlining its pervasiveness in every industry, culture and region, and calling for an end to abuse and an end to impunity. The European Union and the United Nations joined forces to launch the Spotlight Initiative, with the goal of ending all forms of violence against women by 2030. The coalition of faith-based organizations and religious leaders around the world pushing with UNFPA for an end to female genital mutilation, child marriage and other harmful practices continued to grow. Through the power of our partnerships  with the Board, with governments, with our UN partners, civil society, academia, the private sector and other actors -- UNFPA reached more than 33 million women and over 1.6 million adolescents and young people with services for their sexual and reproductive health and to tackle gender-based violence. Contraceptives provided by UNFPA in 2017 potentially averted an estimated 30,800 maternal deaths, 11.6 million unintended pregnancies and 3.6 million unsafe abortions. UNFPA trained thousands of health workers and treated 22,000 women and girls living with obstetric fistula. In war-torn South Sudan, for example, we continue to strengthen midwifery services with support from the Governments of Canada and Sweden. In fact, a midwife at every birth is one of the milestones our South Sudan team has defined for their journey to the transformative result of ending preventable maternal deaths. UNFPA and its partners reached more than 2 million marginalized girls with life skills programmes and 1 million more with prevention and protection services related to child marriage and female genital mutilation. Girls like Adeline. She escaped child marriage at 14, was able to continue her education and is now in college, thanks to the support she received from a UNFPA safe space programme in Burkina Faso. In Southern Africa, which has the worlds highest rate of HIV infection, UNFPA has invested heavily in the integration of HIV and sexual and reproductive health services to maximize efficient use of resources and achieve better results. At the global level, UNFPA, UNAIDS and our partners launched the HIV prevention 2020 road map in October at the first meeting of the Global HIV Prevention Coalition, which I co-chair with the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Dr. Michel Sidib. The goal is to reduce new HIV infections by 75 percent by 2020. Together, UNFPA and UNAIDS are assisting countries in fast tracking the prevention agenda and reducing HIV infections With funding from the United Kingdoms Department for International Development, our project Preventing Maternal Deaths in East and Southern Africa reached 3.4 million users with family planning and trained more than 6,000 providers on a wider choice of contraceptives. In Morocco, where UNFPA leads a joint programme to reduce maternal mortality, we saw a 35% reduction in maternal deaths between 2010 and 2017. Our humanitarian response teams continue to face danger and deliver in hotspots around the world, reaching nearly 11 million people in 2017 with quality sexual and reproductive health services and coordinating global efforts to tackle gender-based violence in emergencies. UNFPA has been at the forefront of responding to the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world. More than 800,000 Rohingya refugees have crossed the border into Bangladesh, the vast majority in just the last five months. Humanitarian needs are overwhelming in the severely overcrowded refugee camps and makeshift settlements in Coxs Bazar. Most of the new arrivals are women, young girls and children, critically in need of protection and basic services. UNFPA has been coordinating efforts to provide life-saving sexual and reproductive health services, to ensure emergency obstetric care and to respond to the needs of survivors of sexual assault and other forms of gender-based violence. With the cyclone season approaching, our continued collective efforts are essential. In 2017, UNFPA thought leadership, advocacy and active engagement at the highest political level in Africa put the demographic dividend firmly on the map, with the African Union focus on Harnessing the Demographic Dividend through Investments in Youth. In July, we convened over 1200 Muslim leaders from around the world for a symposium in NDjamena in Chad, to discuss Islam, the demographic dividend and family wellbeing with an emphasis on ending harmful practices against women and girls. Now, as the demographic dividend agenda gains a life of its own, our work is to ensure that concrete actions deliver rights-based results aligned with the ICPD agenda. UNFPA advocacy continues to drive action to combat discrimination and reach those furthest behind. In Brazil, we led a UN inter-agency initiative called Black Lives to denounce the alarming levels of lethal violence suffered by Afro-descendent youth and to promote avenues for the fulfilment of their human rights to health, including sexual and reproductive health, education, employment, and access to public services and public spaces, without discrimination. Our efforts to combat gender-biased sex selection are also bearing fruit. In Armenia, for example, where UNFPA has been on the forefront in forging a broad-based coalition to eradicate this harmful practice, the sex imbalance at birth dropped from 114 boys born for every 100 girls in 2014 to a ratio of 109/100 in the first half of 2017. 2017 also saw historic legislative action in a number of countries. Tunisia passed a law to end all forms of violence against women and girls, and Lebanon and Jordan repealed so-called Marry your rapist laws. And UNFPA continues to use evidence to inform policy and decision-making. A UNFPA-supported study in Ecuador, for example, revealed that lack of investment in sexual and reproductive health cost the country US$473 million in 2015. The study showed that each US dollar invested in sexual and reproductive health would save the state US$17 in health and social costs. Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, This is just a snapshot of UNFPAs work around the world -- from advocacy to evidence-gathering and analysis to life-saving service delivery on the ground. Expanding options and choices for the poorest women and adolescent girls is the most important thing we do. Empowering them to choose the timing and spacing of pregnancies opens a pathway towards their economic security and independence and towards more balanced economies and societies, as envisioned in the Sustainable Development Goals. This vision of a world where no woman or girl is left behind informs UNFPAs Strategic Plan for the next four years. And we thank the Board once again for your invaluable insights, contributions and support during its development. The new plan is our roadmap for the first leg of the journey to 2030 and includes our three transformative results: End unmet demand for family planning; End preventable maternal deaths; and End violence and harmful practices against women and girls. And our work in collecting and analyzing population data will inform everything we do and ensure that everyone is accounted for and reached in the pursuit of these ambitious aims  all critical benchmarks towards our overarching goal of universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. Going forward, we will continue working with our partners to strengthen collaboration for development, humanitarian action and sustaining peace so that work in one area reinforces the others. Our focus is on preparedness, risk reduction and building resilience  resilient health systems, resilient communities, and resilient women and young people. Where a woman lives should not determine whether she lives. Working together, we can ensure that every woman and adolescent girl everywhere can prevent an unintended pregnancy, can give birth safely and can live free from violence. In all we do, UNFPA will strive to focus on innovation, on being bold, vocal and visible, and on leaving no one behind. Working with our partner agencies, such as UNDP, UNICEF and UN Women, UNFPA is implementing the commitments we made to you in the common chapter of the strategic plan. We are acting collectively on two fronts. First, we are drafting clear, flexible guidance for our country offices to help them use existing mechanisms, processes and programmatic activities to drive collaboration, while avoiding duplication. Second, we are examining ways of going further to increase development impact through greater collaborative advantage. This includes making full use of our existing collective programmatic footprint, expertise and operational assets as well as complementary mandates. Initiatives that might emerge from this analysis would target collective results and joint efforts aimed at transformational change, and offer a sound basis for partnerships with other entities of the United Nations Development System and beyond. We look forward to providing further updates on implementation of the common chapter over the course of the coming year. Mr. President, The integrated results and resources framework (Annex 1) of the new strategic plan, which you have before you, lays out the results that UNFPA expects to achieve over the next four years. It also defines the metrics -- the indicators, baselines and targets -- that will be used to measure progress towards those results and to assess the effectiveness of the strategic plan. To provide just a few highlights: Sixty per cent of the outcome and impact indicators are Sustainable Development Goal indicators, and 53 per cent are common indicators used by other funds and programmes. These shared indicators measure the development results on which we and our partner agencies will work together to achieve common goals. Eighty per cent of the outcome indicators are disaggregated by age, sex, location, wealth quintile, disability and other categories. Sixteen indicators assess progress of UNFPA humanitarian and resilience-building work. And the majority of indicators under organizational effectiveness and efficiency are aligned with Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) recommendations -- six of them shared with other funds and programmes. We are confident that the framework will ensure greater accountability to our stakeholders and improve decision making as we implement the strategic plan. Evaluation is also essential to accountability and to advancing our vital mission. Tomorrows session will provide an important opportunity to discuss in more detail how evaluative evidence and lessons learned are informing our work and strengthening decision-making and the development and implementation of country and regional programmes, the UNFPA strategic plan, and more broadly, efforts to advance the ICPD agenda. Aligned with the new Strategic Plan, the 2018-2021 Quadrennial Budgeted Evaluation Plan presents the strategic approach to evaluation planning at UNFPA. It guides the commissioning, management and use of evaluations, and provides the basis for monitoring and reporting on the implementation of corporate and decentralized programme level evaluations. UNFPA appreciates the consultative manner in which the Quadrennial Plan was developed, reaching a range of stakeholders within the organization and ensuring that evaluation at UNFPA is responsive and useful. Collective learning, knowledge sharing, mutual accountability and capacity building are key to ensuring UNFPA achieves its transformative results. In this spirit, I would like to underscore our continued commitment to supporting evaluation and to cultivating a culture of evaluation use for learning and results. In a time of resource constraints and rapid change, it is time to think boldly about how to identify and scale up solutions. UNFPA has recognized innovation as an indispensable engine for accelerating progress. The formative evaluation of our Innovation Initiative is an effort to do just that, providing real-time feedback and learning to managers to improve programme design, processes and systems. We look forward to sharing more details about this with you tomorrow. All of these efforts are linked to enhancing effectiveness and efficiency in programme delivery. That is also what underpins UNFPA change management efforts, including the Comprehensive Resource Review (CRR), which we updated Board members on at our informal session last week and which we will discuss again with you tomorrow. The CRR aims to ensure that UNFPAs human resources and financial resources are optimally deployed in support of the current and subsequent strategic plans and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is also aligned with ongoing United Nations Reform streams, especially those of the UN Development System and Management Reform, as well as the QCPR. The CRR identified potential high-impact priority areas for streamlining and strengthening UNFPA efficiency and effectiveness. Final recommendations, which focused primarily on headquarters functions, take into account inputs from nearly 100 senior managers from headquarters and the field through inter-divisional task teams and peer review groups. Based on these recommendations, I have taken a series of important initial decisions. Detailed, costed proposals will be developed for inclusion in the revised Integrated Budget proposal for 2018-2021 by March of this year, and we will continue to engage and consult regularly with the Board as this process moves forward. Regarding the inclusion of the humanitarian function in the CRR, I would like to stress that we are not scaling back; rather, we will expand and strengthen our engagement in humanitarian action and our investments in all of our core humanitarian functions, including providing dedicated funding to the secretariat of the Sexual and Gender-Based Violence cluster in Geneva. The recommendation is to: Maintain strong humanitarian presence in New York to support interagency coordination, and Co-locate rapid response, technical and normative standards, and capacity-building functions in Geneva to benefit from proximity to the field; co-location and coherence with our closest humanitarian partners, including WHO, UNHCR, UNICEF, ICRC and others; and stronger participation in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) working groups based in Geneva. Work continues on the best configuration of the expanded humanitarian teams in both locations. I am happy to note, however, that savings from organization wide austerity measures have enabled an initial allocation of $7.5 million to the Emergency Fund and $5 million to the Humanitarian Response Reserve. This represents a major increase over previous years. The CRR exercise will continue, with additional areas for streamlining, improved effectiveness and efficiency, and greater inter-agency coherence. In all change-related initiatives, we will be mindful of the possible benefits and interdependencies of the Secretary-Generals reform initiatives, including co-location and optimizing common back-office functions. Financial benefits from Country Office realignments for 2018-2021 mean that UNFPA will be able to allocate more regular resources for country programmes. UNFPA is making significant investments in Country Office presence, with an increase of 357 posts and service contracts over the past 3 years. 92% are national positions and the vast majority funded from other resources. This represents an almost 11% increase, compared to virtually zero increase in the total number of HQ posts over the same time period. 88% of UNFPA posts and service contracts are in the field, and only 12% at headquarters. And UNFPA has the highest ratio of national professional to international professional officers in the UN system, further evidence of our commitment to empower, build and benefit from national capacity. The overarching aim of all these efforts is to deliver better with a country focus -- to bring our work closer to the 10-year-old-girl, who represents all the women and girls we are proud to serve. She is the symbol of our aspirations in upholding the values and the mandate that underpin our commitment to achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. Five elements are crucial to making all of this possible: Integrity  of process, of systems, of evaluation. Accountability  programme accountability and financial accountability. Optimal use of resources  deployed closer to the ground, closer to the needs, closer to communities and closer to women and girls. People  People are going to achieve this. The people of UNFPA, our dedicated colleagues, in the 155 countries where we deploy our technical know-how to governments, other partners, and to society at large. People trusted to persevere with passion and persistence to honor our mandate. And also you, our Executive Board, who give your time and talent to help us transform this mission into reality. The final element is peace, which is so essential to ensure that women, girls and young people can live their lives in safety, in security and in dignity. Mr. President, As I begin my tenure as Executive Director and work to bring our staff together around the ambitious aims laid out in our strategic plan, and as we all work to deliver together with our UN partners towards our common goals, these elements are foundational. As you know, 2017 was a challenging year for UNFPA funding and resource mobilization. We did not give up or give in. We bounced back, with your help and strong support, and the dedication, creativity and persistence of UNFPA staff around the world. While we are still waiting for the books for 2017 to be closed and audits to be finalized, I am happy to tell you that our revenue for 2017 is expected to come in at an all-time high -- topping the one billion US dollar mark for only the second time in our history. Intensified resource mobilization efforts succeeded in raising funds from a wide range of sources, including a growing amount from the private sector. Despite the loss of $31 million in core funds from one donor, we have managed to keep core funding at almost the same level as 2016, at approximately $350 million. Core funding remains a precious and almost irreplaceable commodity, so it is of particular pride to me that the number of core donors increased to 120 in 2017, which was up from 107 in 2016. And ten more governments made a contribution to co-financing, bringing the overall number of government donors to 130. Most importantly, we feel that this reflects our donors and our partners trust in our delivery at country level and our ability to reach those furthest behind. We are extremely grateful to those donors that increased their core contributions last year. Moreover, many of these pledges are multi-year, which we particularly appreciate in the current political climate. In terms of co-financing, the picture is even better for 2017. We currently predict a record increase in co-financing of about $200 million, for a total of close to $700 million. A particular area of growth was new co-financing contributions from programme countries. We do not take this support for granted. And we will continue to strengthen UNFPA with a focus on effectiveness, transparency, accountability -- and above all, results at country level. We also plan to regularly engage with you on funding issues through the Structured Financing Dialogues, which the Executive Board requested we enhance throughout the year in order to improve the quality and transparency of funding and better match resources to the outcomes of the Strategic Plan. I would also like to note that, as more income became available during 2017, UNFPA provided an additional $10.6 million in regular resources for Country Programmes and $1 million for the Emergency Fund. And as I mentioned earlier, we were also able to fund the Humanitarian Response Reserve, for first time, and to a level of $5 million. In 2018, UNFPA has allocated an additional $14.6 million in regular resources to country programmes, and an additional $2.5 million to the Emergency Fund. Specific attention was paid to the needs of Small Island Developing States, with significant increased allocation to the multi-country programmes in the Caribbean and in Pacific Island States. Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, As we begin the rollout and implementation of our strategic plan, I am confident that UNFPA is poised for success, and our success will be a shared success for the worlds women and adolescent girls when they can claim their right to make their own decisions about their bodies and their futures. In the coming months we will also work with governments and other partners to prepare for 2019, which will mark the 50th anniversary of UNFPA operations and the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action. A series of regional ICPD reviews in 2018 will assess progress, gaps, challenges and emerging issues and lay the groundwork for accelerated action. I am optimistic because I know that UNFPA is better focused and better positioned today to consolidate our gains, to innovate for scale, and to work together with a wide range of partners to deliver strong results. Our Secretary-General, Antnio Guterres, brings a bold new vision for United Nations reform. The United Nations is changing, and UNFPA is embracing and helping drive that change. There may be uncertainties on the horizon, yet our collective dedication to the health and rights of women is stronger than ever. In this new year, with our vibrant new Strategic Plan, we gather our strength, imagination and solidarity to move forward. Thanks to the work of UNFPA and our partners, fewer women are dying giving life, and more women than ever before are using modern contraceptives. Now we need to speed up these efforts to reach a future where zero is the only acceptable number: zero unmet need for family planning, zero maternal deaths, and zero violence and harmful practices against women and girls. We are ready to meet the challenge! Thank you.    "
NA,"press","06 June 2017","    Speech  Statement of Acting Executive Director to Annual Session of Executive Board 2017 06 June 2017   Remarks of Acting UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem to the 2017 Annual Session of the Executive Board of UNDP, UNFPA and UNOPS. Mr. President,Distinguished Delegates,Colleagues and friends,Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning! We are here at this Annual Session of the Executive Board with heavy hearts, but also hope for the future. This session provides an opportunity to look back at what we have achieved, take stock of our progress and challenges, and most importantly, reflect and build upon what we have learned. This is essential as we work to build a better UNFPA, deliver strong results for women, girls and young people, and support countries in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action. The annual report that you have before you highlights our achievements over the past three years. It shows that we have done what we set out to do and are on track to meet most of the 2014-2017 Strategic Plan targets, although funding constraints continue to make this challenging. Going forward, it is important to note that UNFPA faces a significant funding crisis, not least for core resources  a challenge we hope we can solve together in support of women and girls. UNFPA staff and our partners are doing life-saving and life-changing work around the world. In 2014-2016, UNFPAs work helped avert 93,000 maternal deaths and prevent 11 million unsafe abortions and 35 million unintended pregnancies. We reached over 16 million women and girls in humanitarian crises with services for sexual and reproductive health and to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. We helped 272,000 girls avoid genital mutilation. We provided well over a billion male and female condoms, which helped prevent more than 8 million sexually transmitted infections. We reached 54 million users with voluntary family planning services. More than 8 million pregnancies and deliveries were assisted by UNFPA-supported midwives. And the common thread linking all of these efforts is this: In every country where we work, we stand with those left furthest behind. We stand with girls like Faouzia Yaya, forced into marriage at 14 and beaten daily by her husband. With the help of a UNFPA-supported womens organization, Faouzia was able to escape her abusive husband, learn about her sexual and reproductive health, and gain tailoring skills to earn an income. Moreover, thanks to advocacy by UNFPA and others, the Government of Cameroon passed a law last year protecting girls like Faouzia from child marriage. We stand with fistula survivors like Noorjahan in Afghanistan. After suffering in silence for nearly 50 years, she now wakes up every day in a dry bed and is able to play with her grandchildren. We stand with women like Rose Matuulane of Botswana. Thanks to UNFPA, Rose can now access antenatal care, cervical cancer screening, HIV testing and family planning  all at the same clinic in her remote village. In the past, she had to travel over 80 kilometres to the nearest clinic and queue for hours for care. We stand with the millions of girls at risk of female genital mutilation around the world and with women  and men  from Colombia to Gambia to Egypt and the United Kingdom who are pushing to end the practice in their communities. We stand with the countries in Asia and the Caucuses trying to end the harmful practice of gender-biased sex selection. We stand with the uncounted and unreached by supporting countries to collect and analyse census data and use it to shape development policies and priorities that leave no one behind. Member States are our essential partners in this work. The progress and achievements we have made would not have been possible without your political and financial support. Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, We need this support now more than ever. We need you to stand with us  and not only because of UNFPAs significant funding shortfall for 2017 and beyond. We need you to stand with us because while womens rights are being acknowledged as never before, they are also being challenged on a daily basis. Our central goal of achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights is under threat. Women and girls fundamental right to decide freely and for themselves whether or when to have children, to control their bodies and their lives and contribute fully to our collective success, is under threat. The progress we have made together is under threat. Fortunately, in many places, this pushback has also led to renewed commitment and activism. The ""She Decides"" initiative is one example, and we hope to see further commitments at the upcoming London Summit on Family Planning on 11 July. It is estimated that meeting all womens needs for modern contraceptives will cost $5.3 billion more each year than is currently being spent. Additional financial support is critical, and political commitments have not yet translated into adequate funding. We need to remain vigilant and vocal. If we dont, there is a real risk of seeing a reversal of many of the hard-won gains we have achieved in recent years. And large gaps remain. About 830 women still die each day from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Progress would need to be at least three times faster than the current rate to meet the SDG target for reducing maternal deaths by 2030. Contraceptive use stands at around 40 per cent in the least developed countries and is particularly low in Africa, at 33 per cent. We need accelerated action to reach the 225 million women who want modern family planning but are not getting it. One in three women worldwide experiences either physical and/or sexual violence in her lifetime. To reach the child marriage SDG target by 2030, our collective progress would need to be eight times faster. We have our work cut out for us. But we also have a roadmap to guide us  our new strategic plan. As you know, development of the plan has been a truly consultative process. We have set our sights on three transformative results for humanity: to end preventable maternal deaths to end the unmet demand for family planning, and to end gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls. These results align with SDG targets and build on momentum generated by UNFPA and its partners in countries around the world. They are also the clearest expression of our master narrative of delivering a world where very pregnancy is wanted, every child birth is safe, and every young persons potential is fulfilled. We believe that unifying UNFPA around these transformative results has the potential to transform our agency, not for ourselves, but for the disadvantaged millions we exist to serve. We are also firmly committed to delivering as one with our UN system partners in supporting Member States to achieve their development goals. We have strengthened our focus on results and on strategies with the greatest impact, in line with the recommendations of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR). We have taken the request for greater coherence as a guiding principle and have been proactive in facilitating the interagency coordination and planning process on joint indicators and results frameworks. And on behalf of all of us at UNFPA let me say here that we welcome and look forward to working with Achim Steiner in his new role as UNDP Administrator. UNFPA has also been out front within the UN system in applying a diversified business model. We firmly believe that one size does not fit all. And based on lessons learned, we have maintained and further improved our business model to better respond to the diverse needs of Member States, to ensure that no one is left behind and to reach those furthest behind first. Even in countries with relatively fewer needs, our small presence can help mobilize resources and political will to ensure that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights remain a priority, particularly where this agenda is under threat. Mr. President, It is clear that if we want to protect gains and advance real change, business as usual will not do. The time has come to think boldly and innovatively about how we can identify and scale-up solutions in a time of resource constraints and rapid changes  and how we can build alliances across regions and partnerships to multiply impact. The Strategic Plan 2018-21 is one step in that direction, and we count on your partnership, guidance and support to strengthen our work going forward. Let me add that we would also like to urge the Board to adopt the new strategic plan and budget at the Second Regular Session in September, as any delays would unnecessarily disrupt our programme planning at country level with government and national counterparts, as well as budgeting and resource mobilization to support SP implementation. Funding situation As you can imagine, the decline in UNFPA core contributions makes it especially difficult for UNFPA to deliver more for women and girls globally in line with the 2030 Agenda and our new Strategic Plan. UNFPA core resources declined to $352.8 million in 2016. With donor cuts and the declining exchange rate, we currently project core revenue this year at around $325 million, or $25 million below our minimum floor. We appeal to all donors for additional core support in 2017. I believe that raising an additional 25 million in core is achievable, if we work together. Here, I sincerely wish to thank all those Member States who have announced increased Core support for 2017 and in some cases beyond, and all countries who continue to generously support our work. The Executive Director recently represented UNFPA at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, and we look forward to greater engagement with China in empowering women, girls and young people and advancing UNFPAs mandate along the belt and road. We were pleased to partner with China on the launch of the South-South Cooperation Centre of Excellence on Population and Development. We hope it will help foster exchanges of knowledge, research, training and good practices among institutions in the Global South. Mr. President, In this critical year, we urge all governments to please stand up and be counted. Supporting sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and UNFPA as the custodian of the ICPD, has never been more important. We are working hard to increase the number of Member States supporting UNFPA. Our resource mobilization efforts at country level are more focused than ever. We see great promise from a number of emerging donors and have increased collaboration with selected middle income countries to explore opportunities for additional resources. And we are reaching out to private corporations, foundations, high-net-worth individuals and other potential sources of income. We know that communicating results well is key to mobilizing resources and we are stepping up our efforts. Our new Donor Portal will enable donors to track the results they have contributed to and, together with our Transparency Portal, will integrate and visualize financial, statistical and impact data for all UNFPA programme countries. UNFPA is also developing a new branding strategy to help us more clearly and consistently articulate and show who we are, what we do, why we matter and why we are a valuable partner in saving and transforming lives. This is critical for mobilizing political and financial support. Our Strategic Partnerships Branch is working to diversify our portfolio of partners and to attract innovative financing. In 2016, these efforts led to $12.8 million in co-financing and in-kind contributions from the private sector  an increase of 24 per cent over the previous year. And we have not only intensified our partnerships; we have tightened our belts. We have expanded our austerity measures, and as you know, the Funds senior management has undertaken a Comprehensive Resource Review. The goal is to ensure that the strategic plan, resource allocation and organizational structures are optimally aligned to improve programmatic and operational efficiency and effectiveness at all levels of the organization. Recommendations and decisions for immediate, medium- and long-term adjustments are expected to be made before the end of 2017, and we will update the Board on this at the next session. Moreover, a number of key levers for transformational organizational change were identified for further in-depth consideration. Mr. President, We live in a complex and challenging environment. And the face of todays crises  whether drought, famine, displacement, acute malnutrition or cholera  is that of a woman with her children. Of the more than 125 million people that required humanitarian assistance in 2016, over 30 million were women and adolescent girls of childbearing age. UNFPA is working with its humanitarian partners to protect their rights and respond to their needs, providing urgent life-saving assistance and working to build resilience across the humanitarian-development nexus. In Syria and neighbouring countries, we are supporting millions of women and girls made vulnerable by violence, providing them with safe spaces and access to life-saving sexual and reproductive health services and information. In Yemen, last year UNFPA reached more than a million people with services for reproductive health and to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. UNFPA is at the forefront of response efforts in Iraq, delivering life-saving services through mobile and static clinics to populations on the move, in camps and in host communities. This includes providing critical medical and psychosocial treatment and legal aid to Yazidi women and girls rescued from slavery. In Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin, UNFPA is supporting safe spaces and reproductive health and protection services, including psychosocial counselling to women and girls affected by the Boko Haram insurgency. UNFPA is the sole provider of care to the recently released Chibok girls, providing access to medical care, including sexual and reproductive health care, psychosocial counselling and rehabilitation support, dignity kits, and skills to ease their re-integration into society. We are also committed to the safety and security of our own people working in high-risk duty stations. In collaboration with partners, UNFPA provided specialized security training last year to 70 of our own staff and those of sister agencies, and we hope to be able to expand this training in the future. Today, more people are on the move than ever before, and migrant women and girls face heightened risks of violence. UNFPA continues to lead on gender-based violence prevention and response, and we are committed to working with our humanitarian partners to ensure that the unique needs of women and girls are taken into account. In Southeastern Europe, for example, we are supporting refugee and migrant programmes, ensuring availability of SRH and GBV services and working with unaccompanied minors to reduce sexual exploitation. While our humanitarian work focuses on protecting those in transit, the ultimate goal is to ensure that people are choosing, rather than being forced, to migrate. Gaps in services, investments and opportunities for young people, in particular, contribute to increased mobility. We believe that only when every young person is enabled to reach their full potential will we truly make strides towards sustainable development. By investing in young peoples rights, education and health, particularly in their sexual and reproductive health, and building their human capital, countries advance their most important resource for realizing a demographic dividend. UNFPA is continuing to help countries explore how best to align their development plans with the demographic dividend agenda. We recently joined the African Union, the Economic Commission for Africa, and the African Development Bank on the generation of the 2017 Gender Scorecard for Africa. This year, it is scoring countries on those aspects of gender equality most crucial to achieving a demographic dividend. These issues are at the heart of UNFPAs mandate, including the right of women and girls to choose when and whom to marry, when or whether to have children, and to secure quality education and contribute to the modern economy. Mr. President, When countries fail to provide the information and services young people need to protect their sexual and reproductive health, those hardest hit are adolescent girls. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death among girls aged 15 to 19. Suicide is next. Clearly, we need to do more to protect their rights and address their needs. UNFPA is working to ensure that every young person, particularly the most marginalized adolescent girls, has access to comprehensive sexuality education and sexual and reproductive health services, so that they can avoid unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. In 2014-2016, UNFPA and its partners provided 33.4 million adolescents with integrated sexual and reproductive health services. We are working with our partners, with communities and with young people themselves, to protect girls from child marriage and female genital mutilation. The goal is to empower every young person to know and exercise their rights, so that they can realize their potential to transform their lives and our world. Wassila Ali, a 16-year-old participant in UNFPAs adolescent girls initiative in Niger, sums it up best: I learned how to fly with my own wings. Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, If we want a more just, stable and sustainable world, we need to invest in the health and rights of women, adolescent girls and young people. We cannot afford to leave girls like Wassila behind. We count on your support to build a world that doesnt clip girls wings, but rather helps them soar. Together, we can ensure that no one is left behind and build a brighter future  for women and girls, for families, and for the world. Thank you.   "
NA,"news","26 September 2015","News  In region assaulted by Boko Haram, women, young people key to stability   The crisis caused by the Boko Haram insurgency threatens to undermine development throughout the region. Girls in northern Nigeria.  UNFPA Nigeria/Ololade Daniel  26 September 2015   UNITED NATIONS, New York/DAKAR, Senegal  Thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced in the Lake Chad Basin region, the result of a relentless and ongoing campaign of violence by Boko Haram insurgents. With the disaster threatening to undermine decades of development, heads of state, leaders of United Nations agencies and civil society chiefs gathered at UN Headquarters today to address the urgent needs of women and young people, and to forge partnerships for building resilience among terrorized communities. The event, chaired byUNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, underlined the scale of a vast and deteriorating humanitarian crisis. Adolescents, women and children are fighting a daily struggle, said Dr. Osotimehin.  UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, President of Benin Thomas Boni Yayi, and former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo advocate for a comprehensive response to the crisis in the Lake Chad Basin region. UNFPA/Koye Adeboye The impacts of the insurgency reach from Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon to Chad, Benin and beyond. Two-and-a-half million people  including 1.5 million children  have been displaced since May 2013, said Kyung-wha Kang of the UNs Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. This is Africas fastest growing displacement crisis. I thought I could escape. But I was wrong. More than 2,000 girls have been abducted by Boko Haram since 2011, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Fatoumata Ndiaye told attendees at the event. Hafsat Lai, 26, was among those captured. When gunmen came to my village, killing everyone in sight, I thought I could escape. But I was wrong, Ms. Lai recounted, not long ago, at a UNFPA-supported safe space in Nigeria. Ms. Lai was abducted with her 2-year-old son, Ismail, in Nigerias Borno State. It was the last time she saw her two other sons, Bawa, 8, and Mohammed, 6. When the shooting stopped, we were all led like animals into the forest. I saw babies die and watched in pain as children were asked to bury them. In Sambisa Forest, I was asked to renounce my religion or be treated as a slave. I refused, and I was flogged daily.  Women with UNFPA staff in Boko Haram-affected northern Nigeria. UNFPA Nigeria/Ololade Daniel The abuses she described are common among survivors of captivity. Many have been raped, forced to marry their captors, and to give birth without medical assistance. Sexual violence is a deliberate tactic of terrorism, integral to their strategy of domination and self-perpetuation, Zainab Hawa Bangura, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, told the leaders at todays event. Boko Haram has institutionalized the brutalization of women and girls, destroying their communities, and waging war on their physical, sexual and reproductive autonomy and rights. It is a crisis UNFPA and partners are working to address. Many of women and girls among the displaced are pregnant. Some have tested positive for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, Dr. Osotimehin noted. This raises serious concerns for the sexual and reproductive health of a whole generation of women and girls who have endured sexual violence in the hands of their captors. Undermining development It is not only people on the front lines who are affected. Huge displaced populations are being hosted by communities already grappling with hunger and poverty. The unrest has caused widespread school closures and disrupted trade.  Addressing violent extremism in all its aspects is a collective task which demands all hands on deck, said Joy Ogwu, Nigerias ambassador to the UN, reading a statement by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari.  UNFPA/Koye Adeboye About one third of our population is people who have to be helped because of Boko Haram, said Aichatou Boulama, Nigers minister of foreign affairs. The crisis contributes to high mortality rates, low life expectancy, poor access to employment, poor access to education, and poor access to sexual and reproductive health, knowledge and services, explained Dr. Osotimehin. Interventions are needed across the board, said former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo. We cannot talk of education and leave out health. We cannot talk of education and health and leave out employment. Ensuring women, young people have a future Solutions must involve those worst affected  women and youth  the attendees underlined. We have to get women involved in seeking solutions to the problems of security, governance and development. They have to be empowered, they have to become resilient, saidMariam Mahamat Nour, the Chadian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation.  Zainab Hawa Bangura, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, and Gordon Brown, the UN Special Envoy for Global Education, emphasized the impact of the crisis on women and youth. UNFPA/Koye Adeboye Over 60 per cent of populations in the affected countries are below the age of 25, and over 40 per cent are below the age of 14, Dr. Osotimehin said. These youth represent a source of enormous potential for the region. With growing numbers of people entering into working age, the affected countries could experience a boost in economic productivity  known as a demographic dividend  but only if youth see the right investments and opportunities, despite the persistent turmoil. We are dealing with a large population of young people who are susceptible to the influences [of extremists], who need the opportunity of education and employment if they are to see that there is a future for them, said Gordon Brown, the UN Special Envoy for Global Education. It is said you can survive for 40 days without food, eight days without water and eight minutes without air, he said, but not for a second without hope."
NA,"press","11 July 2017","Speech  Family Planning Summit Opening Plenary Remarks 11 July 2017   These opening remarks were delivered by Dr. Natalia Kanem, Acting Executive Director of UNFPA, at the 2017 Family Planning Summit in London. [As prepared for delivery] It is a pleasure to be here  but for all of us at UNFPA, the pleasure is bittersweet. There is a powerful voice missing. Its almost unimaginable that a conference on family planning is taking place without Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin. I know how much he wanted to be here, with the partners in this room working together on this cause. And I know how committed all of us at UNFPA are to carrying on the life-saving work to which he dedicated his life. I thank the Government of the United Kingdom for co-hosting this summit [and Secretary of State Priti Patel] and the Department for International Development for their leadership, steadfast commitment to family planning and strong support of UNFPA. I also thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and especially Melinda Gates, for their partnership and unwavering personal and financial commitment to ensuring that more women and girls around the world are able to access modern contraception. It is fitting that we meet today on 11 July, which we commemorate at the United Nations as World Population Day. This years theme is Family Planning: Empowering People, Developing Nations. We all know how vital these services are for individuals, communities and nations, and for the well-being of current and future generations. When the global family planning community convened here in London five years ago, there was a palpable sense of optimism for the future. It is clear that optimism was justified. I thank Beth Schlachter for her leadership of the FP2020 Secretariat at the centre of what has become the hub for global collaboration on family planning. In just four years, we have reached an additional 30.2 million women and girls with voluntary family planning. In Eastern and Southern Africa, for the first time ever, more than 30 per cent of women and girls are using a modern method of contraception. In West Africa, where contraceptive use has been historically low, the Ouagadougou Partnership has surpassed its 2015 goal of reaching 1 million additional users, and is now aiming to reach 2.2 million additional users by 2020. But while we celebrate our progress, we must also acknowledge where we are falling short. This Summit is a key moment to reflect on lessons learned and on challenges preventing progress, and to mobilize our efforts to meet our promises. We must continue to focus on equity, addressing the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations, including those in humanitarian crises. We must ensure that we can deliver family planning to the last mile so that a choice of quality, affordable contraceptives reach women and girls no matter where they live. We need to ensure that precious financial resources are spent wisely. And we need good data to strengthen our programming and track our progress. UNFPA is fully committed to partnership with countries to help them on their path to sustainable family planning programmes. Programmes that will be the cornerstones of sustainable development and pave the way to realizing the benefits of the demographic dividend. UNFPA and partners help ensure that health centres are stocked with a steady supply and broad mix of contraceptives. Without products, there can be no progress. We are firmly committed to ensuring these live-saving commodities reach the countries that need them as quickly and efficiently as possible. We also want to ensure that our donors get maximum value for every dollar they invest. As part of our efforts on this front, I am excited to announce that  in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the United Kingdoms Department for International Development  we are developing a Bridge Funding Mechanism for the contraceptives that UNFPA provides. This bridge, providing up to $80 million in a revolving pool of financing, will speed up the procurement process, lower the cost of commodities, and reduce stock-outs. In short, it will deliver better results for countries, donors and the women and families that we serve. But, without increased funding there will be nothing to bridge. The Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition estimates that to support the family planning needs of an additional 120 million women by 2020 we need to find an additional $233 million a year. We urgently need donors and especially programme countries to step up and fill this funding gap for contraceptives. That said, on its own delivering contraceptives is not enougheducating people about family planning is key. Young people in particular need access to quality family planning information, so that they are empowered to make decisions about their lives and reach their full potential. We are gathered here because the time to act is now! Today, 214 million women still lack access to family planning. Much greater progress is needed to meet our goal of reaching 120 million more women and girls by 2020. And that is only the first milestone on the pathway to universal access to sexual and reproductive health services by 2030. Among the transformative goals championed by Dr. Babatunde was achieving zero unmet demand for family planning by 2030. Dr. Babatunde ended his statement at the first London summit with a call to action: Until every girl, every woman, everybody wherever they may be, can access reproductive health services, especially family planning, the work is not done. Our work is not done. When it comes to unmet need for family planning, the only acceptable number is zero."
NA,"news","16 June 2020","News  Sahel project helps women raise themselves, their communities from poverty   Ms. Brema trains women in her village to become electricians.  Vincent Tremeau/Banque mondiale  16 June 2020   AM TIMAM, Chad  Once, Adouia Brema was a child bride forced to leave school. Today, she gives her community the gift of light. Her journey  from vulnerable teen mother to solar cell electrician  shows the remarkable feats that marginalized women and girls can achieve when they are empowered with information and economic opportunities. I was only 13 years old when I got married. The day I got married, I was in sixth grade, Ms. Brema recalled. At first, they let me continue going to school. Then I gave birth to my first two children. I found myself all alone in the house and I had to drop out of school so that I could take care of my home and my children. Today, I have eight children. Ms. Brema now has a solar panel installation company, run with other women.  Vincent Tremeau/Banque mondialeHer experience is not unique: Chad has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world  67 per cent of young women were married before age 18, according to the 2019 State of World Population report. For many child brides, marriage means a swift exit from schooling and entry into motherhood. They are less able to advocate for themselves, have less access to health services and higher vulnerability to violence. Their communities forgo the full fruit of their potential. But change is possible. Not just a mans job The Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend Project (SWEDD) gives women and girls across West Africa vocational training so that they can earn more and have a better future. The project also strengthens girls education, increases access to reproductive health services, and engages whole communities on issues including child marriage, human rights and gender equality. Through SWEDD, Ms. Brema enrolled in a course to become an electrician. At first, we thought that electricity, with all those wires, was a mans job, she said. We felt like we couldnt do it. But we were told not to panic. We could do it. She and her classmates learned quickly. We started to grasp some of the notions, such as solar panels, batteries and all of the electrical connections, she said. Kafani Seid became an electrician through the SWEDD programme. Today, like Ms. Brema, she trains other women.  Vincent Tremeau/Banque mondialeI was able to learn the basics in two weeks, and I started to work on my first electrical installations with no fear. Now we have a business. Empowered women lift the community In Chad and other countries where it is working, SWEDD has already provided professional training to more than 154,000 women. When marginalized women and girls are able to access information and opportunities, the benefits accrue to their whole families and communities. Ms. Bremas own experience bears this out. With her business, she and her partners have been able to provide low-cost lighting to their community members. Once the panels have been installed, electricity is free because it comes from the sun, she said. You get electricity day and night. Children use it all the time. Ms. Brema also trains other women in the village. Before, I depended on my husband. But today, we make a profit from each installation... Ever since I learned how to do a paid job, Ive wanted my sisters to follow my example. If they learn skills, they will be able to work and earn money too. Expanding opportunities The pandemic has been hard on the community, Ms. Brema says.  Vincent Tremeau/Banque mondialeThe World Bank recently approved $376 million in additional funds to support the implementation of SWEDDs phase 2, which brings the World Bank's overall support to $680 million. In addition to supporting existing initiatives, the new injection of funding will help governments strengthen legal frameworks that support womens rights to health and education. Parliamentarians, judges and lawyers have already been consulted for this part of the project. Joining phase 2 are the West Africa Health Organization and the African Union. UNFPA will continue to implement SWEDD and provide technical guidance. The countries implementing the project are Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cte dIvoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and the programme will soon roll out in Cameroun and Guinea. Most recently, UNFPA has supported SWEDD in the regional campaign #StrongerTogether, which has the rallying cry My empowerment, my future, even in times of crisis! The campaign shares information about COVID-19, positive gender roles, water and sanitation, and menstrual hygiene. It also highlights distance learning for girls and the importance of having them return to school. We men must seize this time of crisis to be role models for our sons by supporting our wives and daughters. Let's break the cycle of violence, and build a better world for our mothers, wives, sisters and daughters  and for ourselves, the messages say. Protecting and promoting the rights of adolescent girls must be emphasized. As for Ms. Brema, she recently told UNFPA the pandemic has been hard on her family and business.

NA,"press","30 May 2013","Press Release  UNFPA Welcomes Eminent Persons Call to Place People, Particularly Women, at Heart of Transformative Development 30 May 2013   UNITED NATIONS, New YorkDr. Babatunde Osotimehin, the Executive Director of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, warmly welcomed the report of the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda that was presented today to the United Nations Secretary-General. We strongly agree with the Eminent Persons declaration that people should be at the heart of any development agenda and no person denied universal human rights and basic economic opportunities on any grounds, said Dr. Osotimehin. We also echo their call for a people-centred agenda that ensures the equal rights of women and girls, and empowers them to take leadership roles in their societies. UNFPA strongly believes that women and girls should have the means to exercise their right to make choices on their health, particularly their sexual and reproductive health, freely and without coercion, said Dr. Osotimehin. The Eminent Persons report shows, once again, that investing in womens health is not only the right thing to do, but also smart economics. We also fully support their proposals to decrease maternal death and ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. Noting that no society has become prosperous without a major contribution from its women, the Eminent Persons called for womens equal and full participation in decision-making. This is yet another testament to the fact that women are major drivers of economic growth in their communities and countries, said Dr. Osotimehin. But for them to fulfil this potential as economic drivers, we must re-double our efforts to enable them to determine if, when and how often to have children. Only then would they be better able to pursue education, be more economically productive and help end poverty. Furthermore, added Dr. Osotimehin: We strongly welcome the Eminent Persons recommended goal to end child marriage. Child marriage threatens the potential of millions of our very own daughters, nieces and grand-daughters. We particularly welcome their support for education for young people which will also provide them with an understanding of sexual and reproductive health. UNFPA believes that young people, particularly those living in poverty, must get their rightful place at the table, so that every young person's potential is fulfilled, said Dr. Osotimehin.

Young people. Todays adolescents and youth are 1.8 billion strong and one quarter of the worlds population. They are shaping social and economic development, challenging social norms and values, and building the foundation of the worlds future. They have high expectations for themselves and their societies, and are imagining how the world can be better. Connected to each other as never before through new media, they are driving social progress and directly influencing the sustainability and the resilience of their communities and of their countries. These young people face many obstacles, ranging from discrimination, marginalization, and poverty, to violence. They find it hard to find a first job, so we believe a jobs target with a specific indicator for youth employment, should be included in the next goal framework Young people must be subjects, not objects, of the post-2015 development agenda. They need access to the right kind of health (including access to SRHR) and education to improve their job prospects and life skills, but they must also be active participants in decision-making, and be treated as the vital asset for society that they are. Girls and Women. The majority of those living in extreme poverty are female. A people-centred agenda must work to ensure the equal rights of women and girls, and empower them to participate and take on leadership roles in public life. Women across the world have to work hard to overcome significant barriers to opportunity. These barriers can only be removed when there is zero tolerance of violence against and exploitation of women and girls, and when they have full and equal rights in political, economic and public spheres. Women and girls must have equal access to financial services, infrastructure, the full range of health services including SRHR, water and sanitation, the equal right to own land and other assets, a safe environment in which to learn and apply their knowledge and skills, and an end to discrimination so they can receive equal pay for equal work, and have an equal voice in decision-making. Gender equality is integrated across all of the goals, both in specific targets and by making sure that targets are measured separately for women and men, or girls and boys, where appropriate. But gender equality is also an important issue in its own right, and a stand-alone goal can catalyse progress. Demographic change: Global population growth is expected to slow to just one per cent per year between now and 2030, when the global population will likely reach 8 billion, on its way to more than 9 billion by 2050. There will be more people and older people. The impact of both trends must be taken into account. The worlds labour force will grow by about 470 million. For many developing countries, this surge is a demographic dividend in waiting, if the extra people are given the right opportunities, services and skills. Creating so many jobs sounds daunting, but it is less than what nations achieved between 1995 and 2010, when the global labour force grew by almost 700 million. International Migration: The universal human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants must be respected. These migrants make a positive economic contribution to their host countries, by building up their labour force. Sending countries benefit from getting foreign exchange in the form of remittances and from greater trade and financial flows with countries where they have a large diaspora. By 2030, as global population rises, there could be 30 million more international migrants, remitting an additional $60 billion to their home countries through lowcost channels. Urbanization: The world is now more urban than rural, thanks to internal migration. By 2030 there will be over one billion more urban residents and, for the first time ever, the number of rural residents will be starting to shrink. This matters because inclusive growth emanates from vibrant and sustainable cities, the only locale where it is possible to generate the number of good jobs that young people are seeking. Good local governance, management and planning are the keys to making sure that migration to cities does not replace one form of poverty by another, where even if incomes are slightly above $1.25 a day, the cost of meeting basic needs is higher. The Eminent Person proposed 12 illustrative goals, including: EMPOWER GIRLS AND WOMEN AND ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY 2a. Prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against girls and women2b. End child marriage2c. Ensure equal right of women to own and inherit property, sign a contract, register a business and open a bank account2d. Eliminate discrimination against women in political, economic, and public life ENSURE HEALTHY LIVES 4a. End preventable infant and under-5 deaths4b. Increase by x% the proportion of children, adolescents, at-risk adults and older people that are fully vaccinated4c. Decrease the maternal mortality ratio to no more than x per 100,0004d. Ensure universal sexual and reproductive health and rights4e. Reduce the burden of disease from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, neglected tropical diseases and priority non-communicable diseases "
NA,"press","13 August 2013","Speech  Latin America and the Caribbean Are Set to Fulfill the Vision of Well-being and Dignity Set Out in Cairo 19 Years Ago 13 August 2013   Opening remarks by UNFPA Executive DirectorDr. Babatunde Osotimehinduring the Latin America and Caribbean ICPD review Conference in Montevideo, Uruguay As prepared for delivery Excellency, Jose Mujica, President of the Oriental Republic of UruguayHonorable Minister Luis Almagro, Minister of Foreign AffairsHonorable Dr. Leonel Briozzo, Vice Minister of HealthMs. Alicia Barcena, Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the CaribbeanExcellencies,Distinguished delegates and participants,Ladies and gentlemen, It is my honour and pleasure to be with you today for the opening of the Regional Conference on Population and Development of Latin America and the Caribbean, dedicated to the review of the implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and its follow up beyond 2014. I would like to thank you, Mr. President, and the Uruguayan people for your hospitality in hosting this conference. Your great support for human rights and the development agenda of the United Nations, particularly the ICPD agenda, makes it especially fitting that we are here this week. Uruguay serves as an example of great social progress in a region where respect for human rights and economic advancement have become an inspiration to other developing countries. I am also grateful to Ms. Alicia Barcena, Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). We are indebted to ECLAC for their support in organizing this conference and for their excellent partnership, which helps us engage this region more effectively. This historic conference comes at an opportune moment. It is being held in the context of two of the most consequential activities of the United Nations: the ICPD Beyond 2014 Review and global discussions on the post-2015 development agenda. Both processes seek to create the framework for a world in which everyone lives in dignity and enjoys well-being now and for generations to come. Your discussions over the next few days and the recommendations that emerge from this conference will form a core part of the future agenda for the ICPD  which will be presented by the Secretary-General in his reports to Member States at the 2014 session of the UN Commission on Population and Development and a special session of the UN General Assembly in September 2014. This opportunity to link the ICPD review, and the regional and global data it has generated, with post-MDG discussions at national, regional and global levels will ensure that we are truly able to put people and rights at the centre of the development agenda beyond 2015, an essential precondition for meaningful development outcomes. Let me begin by mentioning that today is International Youth Day. The ICPD Programme of Action placed the rights of young people at the very heart of development. Todays young people, the largest generation the world has ever known, are powerful change agents who possess not just the will, but also the capacity, to define a global human rights and development agenda that is responsive to the needs of everyone. Engaging young people  working with them, listening to them, learning from them  is a priority for UNFPA. We are pleased to be joined here today by a key partner in this endeavour, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Youth, Mr. Ahmad Alhendawi, whose presence demonstrates his commitment to the regions young people. Ladies and gentlemen, While the world has seen great progress since the historic United Nations conferences and summits of the 1990s and the Millennium Summit, it is clear that we have not been so successful in matching our actions to our ambitions. In every part of the world, we see growing expectations and demands for a change in the way societies live. It is impossible to speak of the progress countries have made in implementing the ICPD Programme of Action without acknowledging the contribution of strong civil society organizations, including youth groups and faith-based organizations, and the daily decisions of parents and other family members to educate children, especially girls, and support women and girls to reach their highest potential and live in dignity. Today, people in Latin America and the Caribbean are more empowered than they were 20 years ago. More and more, people are recognizing themselves as citizens and are finding mechanisms to make their voices heard. The region has seen considerable economic growth over the past decade, and social protection programmes in many countries are ensuring that more people, including the poor and disenfranchised, are benefiting from this growth. We thank your governments for the commitment, leadership and support that have enabled so many people to live healthy, fulfilling and dignified lives. While we take satisfaction in the great progress countries in this region have made, it is important to match that progress with the vision that drove our leaders in Cairo in 1994 during the International Conference on Population and Development. The vision that what matters about human beings is not their numbers but the quality of their lives The vision that every human being is entitled to economic security The vision that no woman should die giving life; that everyone should have access to information, education and services, including sexual and reproductive health services, to live responsible lifestyles, protect themselves from preventable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and realize their full potential... The vision that everyone has the right to decide when and how often to have children; to be free from discrimination or physical harm; and to live and die in dignity And the knowledge that all of these conditions are critical for environmental sustainability. The analysis of the ICPD survey in this region shows, however, that its too soon to pat ourselves on the back.Weve seen important progress in gender equality and in womens participation in the social, economic and political spheres, but much work remains in order to achieve full gender equality, increase the capacity of women to exercise their sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, reduce gender-based violence, improve the balance between womens productive and reproductive lives, and in so doing, increase their ability to participate much more fully in the economy, in political processes and in public life. There are fewer than 900 days to the MDG deadline. Promoting gender equality in a post-2014 world includes finishing the work of the Millennium Declaration. Unfortunately, the MDGs that are most off-track, including in this region, are those directly linked to achieving gender equality, such as reducing maternal death and ensuring universal reproductive health and rights. This is despite the fact that there is by now overwhelming evidence that gender inequality significantly slows economic growth in both rich and poor countries. Across the world, in all societies, women and girls consistently face a range of barriers to equality, such as wage gaps, gender-based violence, early childbirth and child marriage. The poor and otherwise socially disadvantaged are further marginalized by crippling combinations of gender discrimination and poverty. Tackling the gender inequalities and critical barriers that prevent women and girls from exercising their rights and empowering themselves must be at the heart of our efforts to create sustainable, prosperous and resilient societies. There is a pressing need to involve men more in family life and in child-care roles and to end gender-based violence, which remains one of the most prevalent forms of human rights violations in the region. Young people must be able to exercise their right to education, including age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education; their right to sexual and reproductive health, through youth-friendly health services that include access to contraception; their right to decent jobs and to participate in decision-making. Older persons need to be assured of access to social protection systems and allowances, including pensions, and to health and care that enables them to make full use of their skills and abilities so that they enjoy independence and dignity throughout the course of their lives. We must also protect the rights of migrants and combat trafficking; address exclusion, discrimination and inequality, especially with respect to indigenous peoples and afro-descendants. One of the key achievements of this region since 1994 has been the impressive rate of economic growth and the reduction of poverty. But even here, the results have been mixed, with persistent inequality both within and between countries. The Global Survey highlights notable initiatives in the region that, if taken to scale with proper funding and quality assurance, could increase their impact. For example, 31 out of 33 countries in the region have reported progress in access to maternal health-related services, and there is an increase in the number of deliveries in health establishments. However, maternal death continues to be a health and social challenge, particularly among indigenous and afro-descendant populations and among the poorest of the poor. Alongside the issue of maternal health is that of adolescent pregnancy, which has long been a matter of concern in the region. The adolescent fertility rate in Latin America and the Caribbean is the second highest in the world, with a rate of 70 births per every 1,000 adolescent girls between 15 and 19 years of age. Almost 20% of all births in the region are from adolescent mothers. The region also has the highest rates of unsafe abortion.Adolescent pregnancy is closely linked to poverty, illiteracy, location, socio-economic disparities, social exclusion and discrimination. It is our poor girls who suffer the consequences of unplanned pregnancies, and this fuels the inter-generational transmission of poverty. We must prevent these pregnancies and enable these girls to stay in school. However, we cannot end the problem of teenage pregnancy by ignoring reality. Adolescents are often sexually active. The best way to help them through their transition to adulthood is to recognize this fact. Many of us have been faced with the challenge of recognizing and guiding the sexual evolution of our daughters and sons. The evidence shows that what works best is age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education, which combines the teaching of responsible decision-making and life skills with access to adequate information, counseling, and youth-friendly services, including contraception. Protecting and promoting the rights of young people to make choices related to their sexual and reproductive health enables them to make other critical life choices and realize life-changing opportunities  for example, to stay in school or to find decent employment. Several countries are poised to reap the demographic dividend, but this requires that decision-makers and planners invest now in programmes to improve young peoples access to decent work, education, social participation and health services, particularly sexual and reproductive health services. This is both your regions challenge and its opportunity. Fully engaged, educated, healthy and productive adolescents and youth can help break the cycle of poverty and strengthen their families, communities and nations. Given the opportunity, young people can contribute enormously to the development of your countries and to a better future for us all. The outcome of this conference should send a clear message to the 140 million young people living in the region that we are listening to them and that we want to join forces to provide opportunities for those among their ranks who dont have access to school or work. Working together we can mount an integrated response for the up to 32 per cent of young people in the region suffering the consequences of school dropout, adolescent pregnancy, unemployment, drug addiction, or conflict with the law. This is a moral obligation and a social, economic and political necessity. Ladies and Gentlemen, This region also faces environmental challenges, such as drought and floods, water and energy shortages. There is no question that addressing these issues requires proactive planning based on population data and evidence of what policies work. This includes fostering awareness of the linkages between population policy and the environment. Sustainable consumption and production patterns that protect the environment are critical, and help ensure a higher quality of life for us all. This should not come at the expense of anyones right to development, however. The global development agenda beyond 2015 should provide options that enable equitable progress within a framework of sustainable development. Fortunately, we have the data and information necessary to address these challenges. The region has strong institutional capacity in data generation, but we need to ensure that these data are used for effective policymaking. The information systems that are now available to policy makers, civil society, academia, social networks and individuals can help us bridge the implementation gap, enhance our capacity to monitor policies and improve transparency and accountability. Governments, civil society organizations, the United Nations and others are calling for a post-2015 agenda grounded in principles of human rights, equality and sustainability. While the discussions so far call for a universal agenda, there is agreement that it must be flexible enough to take into account the particular needs and challenges of different regions and countries. In the regional meeting on the post-2015 agenda, Latin America and the Caribbean clearly articulated that the unfinished MDGs need to be squarely reflected. The region also recognized that achieving a healthy life, eradicating child and maternal death and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, require universal access to quality health care, including to sexual and reproductive health, particularly focusing on the needs and rights of women and adolescents. The region is also calling for the post-2015 agenda to consider the challenges posed by a rapid demographic transition that, on the one hand, brings the promise of a demographic dividend if decent employment opportunities for young people are created and, on the other, a potential social and economic liability for countries where these opportunities do not exist. This transition also brings rapid growth in the ageing population, which requires social protection policies that address the needs of older people. The dependence of wealth creation on natural and environmental resources, and traditional forms of manufacturing and industry without the introduction of innovation, deepens the risks of unsustainable production, climate change and growing socio-environmental conflicts. These challenges require new models of development that help change patterns of production and consumption. Issues related to urban planning are also critical for Latin America and the Caribbean, which is the most urbanized region of the planet. Rights-based migration policies are also essential in order to move towards more sustainable and resilient human settlements. We fully support the regions efforts to improve governance and strengthen institutions  sustainable development requires responsible governance and effective, rights-based universal social protection policies in health, education and employment. The private sector also has a role to play in realizing these aims. Excellencies,Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, Recognizing the uniqueness and importance of each individual is key to formulating policies that respond to their needs and to those of society as a whole. How we adapt existing mechanisms and institutions to more effectively mainstream population and development issues in policy and planning will determine how successful we are in responding to the aspirations of our people  our mothers and fathers, working women and adolescent girls, young men and women from all walks of life, the elderly, the disabled, migrants, the indigenous and afro-descendant, the poor and excluded. They are all counting on us to fulfill the vision of well-being and dignity set out in Cairo 19 years ago.Let us keep this vision in mind during our deliberations this week. It is the vision of a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe and every young persons potential is fulfilled  where human rights are respected and peoples diversity is celebrated. Let us, once and for all, make this vision a reality. Thank you. "
NA,"press","05 April 2019","Speech  52nd Session of the Commission on Population and Development 05 April 2019   Remarks by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem at the closing session of the 52nd Session of the Commission on Population and Development.  Mr. Chairperson,Excellencies,Distinguished delegates, Civil Society friends,Youth participants,Ladies and gentlemen, Congratulations to all on the successful outcome of this 52nd Commission! On the 25th anniversary of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, a historic Political Declaration serves as a direct, powerful reaffirmation of the ICPD Agenda and its centrality to the 2030 Agenda. It recognizes how far we have come and how far we have left to go. And it delineates what is needed to get there: resources, partnerships, innovation and data. We know the path forward; therefore, let us use this Declaration to scale up and to push faster. On behalf of all of us at UNFPA, I thank our distinguished chair, His Excellency Ambassador Courteney Rattray, for his vision, leadership and engagement, which were instrumental to a positive outcome this week. Let me also thank the other members of the Bureau for their commitment over the past year to making this result a reality. I thank the UN Population Division for their stewardship of the Commission, and I acknowledge with gratitude the contributions of my dedicated UNFPA colleagues to the success of this years session. And allow me to thank all of you, distinguished representatives and delegates of the Commission, for your hard work and active participation in the deliberations this week, and indeed over the past year as this process built from national to regional to global. We should all be heartened by the number, depth and breadth of the national statements delivered during the general debate. Your discussions this week were rooted in the foundational message of the ICPD Programme of Action: that the rights, health and well-being of individuals, and especially women and girls, are at the heart of our collective aspirations. You pronounced clearly upon: The continued centrality of the ICPD Programme of Action, including for the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs; The critical importance of the empowerment of women and girls, and the elimination of gender-based violence and harmful practices; The need to achieve universal health coverage that includes access to essential sexual and reproductive health services; The potential of harnessing the demographic dividend via expanded access to family planning and investments in young people, and the work that must be done to achieve it; The reality and diversity of ageing and low fertility, migration, displacement and urbanization, and the need to take measures to ensure that we deliver for all people amidst these realities; And the necessity of timely, disaggregated population data for fashioning policies and programmes that truly leave no one behind. The five Regional Reviews were a major contributor to this weeks success, the result of so much work by so many in and out of the room. I thank the distinguished Chairs of these reviews, who shared with the Commission findings and recommendations that guide regional and national work and help countries and regions learn from each other. We noted with satisfaction the great benefits stemming from these Regional Reviews, and I believe that the Commission would well wish to consider having regional perspectives be a regular and ongoing part of the Commissions future deliberations. Civil society organizations were integral in developing the vision of the Cairo Programme of Action and seeing it through. They continue to be stalwart partners in advancing the implementation of the ICPD agenda, improving the lives and wellbeing of all people. Their contribution to this session and to the regional reviews has been crucial. We all depend on cooperation with civil society to ensure that we fulfil our sustainable development objectives and reach those furthest behind first. On behalf of UNFPA and the UN system, let me affirm our commitment to continue to be your partner in the full achievement of the Programme of Action, on which the success of the 2030 agenda depends. At UNFPA, we have set our sights upon three ambitious aims for 2030: Zero unmet need for family planning, Zero preventable maternal deaths, and Zero violence and harmful practices against women and girls, including an end to child marriage and female genital mutilation. High-quality population data is the foundational element. It will help us zero in on where the needs are greatest and end the invisibility of those furthest behind. I have every confidence that together, we can get there. Next year, this Commission will meet to deliberate upon on the special theme Population, food security, nutrition and sustainable development. This is an issue of paramount importance, including for maternal and child health, for gender equality, in humanitarian and fragile circumstances, and for adapting to a changing world. Lets build on this weeks success and the momentum we collectively will generate at the upcoming Nairobi Summit to accelerate the promise of ICPD25. Let us ensure that next year the proceedings of the 53rd Commission will be as focused, productive, substantive and constructive as this years. Lives depend on it. Mr. Chair, Distinguished delegates, dear participants, Consider these words about hope from the poet and Nobel laureate SeamusHeaney, who wrote: History says, Dont hope On this side of the grave, But then, once in a lifetime, The longed-for tidal wave Of justice can rise up, And hope and history rhyme Our joint achievements to date demonstrate whats possible. Fifty years after the founding of UNFPA and 25 years after Cairo, we can claim unprecedented successes for the population and development agenda. The more than 40% decrease in maternal mortality over the past 25 years is just one marker of world progress. Yet the unfinished business of the ICPD Programme of Action remains. Millions upon millions of women and girls are still waiting for world promises to be fulfilled. Its time for urgent action to fully realize this vital agenda, which is so integral to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Nairobi Summit in November will call upon all of us  the United Nations, governments, civil society, academia, the private sector, young people  to work in concert as partners, committing political and financial support to accelerate the promise of ICPD at the 25-year mark. Thus, we make hope and history rhyme. I trust that you join me in leaving re-invigorated, with a renewed energy and collective spirit that recognizes the urgency of action now, today. Thank you once again. I wish all who are traveling safe journeys home. Adelante! Onward to the Nairobi Summit in November!"
NA,"press","28 January 2015","    Speech  Statement of the Executive Director at the First Regular Session of the Executive Board 2015 28 January 2015   Remarks of UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, as prepared for delivery, addressing First Regular Session of the Executive Board of UNDP, UNFPA and UNOPS Before I begin my formal remarks, let me say that it is with sadness that we learned yesterday of the passing of a cherished colleague and friend, Mrten Grunditz, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Sweden to the United Nations and President of the Executive Board in 2012. Mrten was a strong voice for gender equality and womens empowerment and a steadfast advocate for sexual and reproductive health and rights. We at UNFPA would like to extend our heartfelt sympathy to the Government of Sweden, to his colleagues at the mission and to Mrtens family for their loss. Mr. President,Distinguished Members of the Executive Board,Colleagues and friends,Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning! First let me congratulate you, Ambassador Carrera, on your election as President of the Executive Board. Id also like to welcome the rest of the Bureau, Mr. Sahak Sargsyan of Armenia, Ambassador Hiroshi Minami of Japan, Ambassador Kelebone Maope of Lesotho, and Ambassador Durga Prasad Bhattarai of Nepal. Let me also take this opportunity to thank Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji and the outgoing Bureau for their leadership and partnership over the course of 2014. Your engagement was critical to the successful outcomes of the ICPD review, the UN General Assembly Special Session on the ICPD beyond 2014, as well as to the outcomes of the consultations related to the post-2015 development process. The Boards guidance will continue to be critical to our efforts during 2015  a pivotal year, as we build on the advances of the MDGs and chart a new path forward for sustainable global development in the years ahead. As I embark on my second term, I look forward to continuing our work together. In 2014, the 20-year review of the ICPD in action revealed what the world can achieve when it focuses on common goals.We have indeed made significant progress since Cairo. Fewer women are dying in pregnancy and childbirth. More girls are in school. More people are moving out of poverty. But the review also showed that if our common goals are not directed towards inclusion, are not underpinned by human rights, then grave inequalities emerge. 2015 offers a new opportunity for the world to galvanize around a common and uniting agenda  a promise to and for the future. Building on the gains made under the framework of the ICPD and the Millennium Development Goals, the world will adopt a new universal sustainable development framework. People and the planet must be at its heart. 2014 was also a trying year. UNFPA and our development partners faced an unprecedented number of complex challenges  from the protracted conflict in Syria to the eruption of conflict in South Sudanfrom the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to the epidemic of gender-based violence facing women and girls worldwide. From the brutality of Boko Haram in Nigeria to the viciousness of ISIS in Syria and Iraq From the streets of Baga to Raqaa to Paris, violent extremists continue to exact a horrific toll. With human rights and our common humanity in the balance, it is clear that the United Nations is needed now more than ever. Now more than ever, it is time for global action to uphold human dignity, protect human rights and promote peace and prosperity. Now more than ever, it is time to invest in the power of people  particularly the worlds 1.8 billion young people, and especially adolescent girls  to create a sustainable world where everybody has equal opportunities.In Addis Ababa in July, the global community will meet to negotiate a comprehensive financing framework for the Sustainable Development Goals. We hope they will focus not only on who will pay what and why, but also on key investments that must be made in people, particularly in those most in need  smart investments in human capital that can yield enormous returns for improved well-being, poverty eradication, economic growth and sustainable development. We at UNFPA remain firmly committed to enhancing our efforts, and mobilizing the broadest possible support, to promote the sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights of all people; to ensure that no woman dies giving life; to enable young people to realize their full potential and thereby set the terms by which everyone everywhere can live in dignity and be accorded their human rights. Towards these ends, we will continue to focus on five priority areas, which provide a powerful platform for significant change. We will: Strengthen our work in the area of the provision of quality reproductive health services, especially as it relates to the attainment of MDG 5a & b, which includes the provision of family planning by choice not chance. This is all the more important in the year 2015, which is significant for both the end of the MDGs and the evolution of the Sustainable Development Goals; Realize UNFPAs strategy for young people, with a particular focus on adolescent girls; Facilitate greater South-South cooperation as a platform for greater exchange and better implementation; Establish ourselves as a center of excellence in data for development; Strengthen UNFPAs humanitarian work, with a focus on gender-based violence. And in doing so, we will focus on strategies that have proven effective. Todays unprecedented cohort of young people presents an enormous opportunity to transform the future for the better. But they can do so only if they have the education and skills they need, health and real choices in life.Investing in the human capital of young people, especially adolescent girls, can help countries reap a demographic dividend that can lift millions out of poverty, raise living standards and establish a foundation for sustained and resilient development. That is the story of East Asias prosperity, and we believe that the same sort of targeted investments in young people could help countries in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions spark their own economic miracles. UNFPAs experience in engaging with and empowering young people and our work to help countries realize their demographic dividends will be more important than ever in the new development era. We are currently applying this expertise in the Sahel, in partnership with the World Bank Group and others. These countries have some of the highest fertility rates in the world. As a result, they are furthest behind in the demographic transition needed to realize the social and economic benefits of the dividend. Informed choices are central to human rights, human dignity and human empowerment. We need to ensure that the most marginalized women and adolescent girls are afforded choices that enable them to lead dignified, productive lives  not least the choice to plan the number, timing and spacing of their children. We know that access to comprehensive reproductive health services, including contraceptives and voluntary family planning, saves lives, protects womens health and helps unleash the power of women to contribute to their societies and drive sustainable economic growth. In 2014, UNFPAs Global Programme to Enhance Reproductive Health Commodity Security supplied approximately $100 million worth of contraceptives, averting an estimated 7.8 million unintended pregnancies. The Programme continues to provide quality, life-saving maternal health medicines, strengthen health systems and support countries facing humanitarian crises. In the Ebola affected countries, for example, funds from the Global Programme were promptly reprogrammed to address health system disruptions and provide continued access to reproductive health services. Stable funding is essential to continue this essential work in all of the 46 countries the Programme supports. Data is another priority area for UNFPA and a powerful tool for development. Data is essential to make evidence-based decisions and drive accountability. It can indicate whether our investments are making meaningful, measurable change in the lives of the most vulnerable. It can strengthen communities understanding of their own needs and assist people in holding decision makers accountable. This year UNFPA will focus on strengthening its strategic direction, internal capacity and key partnerships for data for development. Currently, the world knows the least about people who have the least  in other words, the very people we need most to reach. The data revolution and the promise of big data have particular resonance for our work to promote equity and human rights and ensure that all women, adolescent girls and young people everywhere are able to achieve their full potential. Finally, as we have seen in recent years, the number and scope of humanitarian crises worldwide is increasing. UNFPA will continue to strengthen our efforts as a trusted humanitarian partner capable of delivering effectively in a range of emergency settings. This includes particular focus on preventing and addressing the impacts of gender-based violence, which is magnified in crisis situations. So those are our priorities for the next three years. Now Id like to speak to you about some of the actions we are taking to strengthen the organization and reinforce our work in these key focus areas. Mr. President,Over the past four years, UNFPA has enhanced its operations and sharpened its strategic vision. Building on this foundation and what we have learned from the ICPD review, the Open Working Group process and ongoing negotiations around the post-2015 agenda, we feel an urgent need to reposition our organization to be able to engage more proactively in the changing development and financial landscape. We have noted the concerns of the Board in this regard, and we continue to rely on you to guide us through this process. Our challenge now is to accelerate our efforts to deliver on our Strategic Plan and to achieve the MDGs. The Fit for Purpose process and the post-2015 agenda offer opportunities for UNFPA. However, the changing environment and competition for scarce resources requires us to be more dynamic and strategic in advocating for our issues with Member States and our various partners. To facilitate our engagement with governments and the development of strategic partnerships, and enhance our communication, resource mobilization and outreach, we will establish a new Division for Governance and Multilateral Affairs. This will further the work of the Executive Board branch, the post-2015 team and the Liaison Offices in Geneva and Addis Ababa to strengthen UNFPAs engagement with Member States. The inclusion of environmental scanning and the two Liaison Offices in this division will ensure a deepened and consistent dialogue with governments, furthering the organizations efforts to implement the ICPD Programme of Action and contribute to sustainable development. A new division for Communication and Strategic Partnerships will also be created, comprising the work undertaken today by the Media and Communication and Resource Mobilization branches. It will also include a Strategic Partnerships Branch, which will include UNFPAs work with parliamentarians and CSOs. The Liaison Offices in Copenhagen, Brussels and Tokyo and Washington DC will be part of this Division. In addition to strengthening UNFPAs work to build strategic partnerships, it will also help us better tell our success stories, advocate for our issues and redefine our resource mobilization work to maintain support from our traditional donors while tapping new sources of funding, as the Board has challenged us to do. These two divisions will replace the current IERD structure, and internal recruitment is under way for directors to head them. The importance of this holistic approach to engagement really hit home for me during a recent trip to a programme country that I wont name but which had opposed some of the strong positions we took last year. I was pleasantly surprised to find in our meetings that when we broke down the issues, the government was actually on board with us. During the visit, we also met with potential new partners in the private sector, especially within the media industry, who were very excited about the prospect of working with us. So telling our story effectively and thinking outside the box is critically important to mobilize new resources and partners. And we hope the changes we are putting in place will facilitate this. Mr. President,Let me take this time to thank all our donors for their support, particularly their contributions to core resources. On the subject of resources, Id also like to mention an additional challenge we currently face  the volatility of exchange rates in global markets. Given the current situation, UNFPA encourages all donors to pay their contributions early in 2015 in order to help us better plan our activities. I will come back to you at our Annual Session when we have been able to better analyze any implications for UNFPA in view of the strong US dollar. As non-core resources have started to exceed core resources, it is increasingly important to ensure that they are harnessed effectively to meet our organizational objectives and are managed in accordance with our policies and procedures as well as donor agreements. To this end, we have established a Non-core Funds Management Unit, which will ensure non-core funds are allocated to countries with the greatest needs and that they are used effectively. The Unit will bring a much-needed integrated approach to core and non-core resources, with distinct reporting to donors on the added value of non-core resources but in the context of UNFPAs overall work. We know that resource mobilization depends on performance and demonstrating value for money  on accountability and on results. UNFPA sincerely appreciates the 2014 MOPAN Common Approach Assessment Report, and we are very pleased with the positive findings of the report overall, which rates UNFPAs performance under the majority of dimensions as 'adequate' or 'strong'. Moreover, we welcome the unified efforts of the 19 donor governments in producing this increasingly recognized joint assessment instrument. We at UNFPA are closely following discussions in the General Assembly leading up to the Addis meeting on financing for development. We understand that while ODA is essential, it is not nearly enough to implement such an ambitious development agenda. Domestic resource mobilization, private sector investment, loans and other instruments will be critical. UNFPA needs to be able to take advantage of various opportunities  not only to mobilize financial resources, but also technical cooperation and expertise  from Member States on the ground where we work. In response to the growing importance of South-South Cooperation as a means of implementation for sustainable development, UNFPA is stepping up its efforts in this area. We know that some of the best development solutions come from countries facing similar challenges. Our new coordination efforts for South-South cooperation bring together all UNFPAs experience and expertise on the subject, led by very senior management equipped with the skills and political acumen to advance our work in this area. Delivering effectively requires that we have the right people  with appropriate skills sets, strengths and expertise  in the right place. As I have already mentioned, data for development is another of our corporate priorities for 2015 and beyond. Measuring progress towards the new Sustainable Development Goals will require a steady flow of high-quality, timely, authoritative, and accessible data. UNFPAs census work, while critically important, is not enough. We need to strengthen our leadership in the area of data, working with governments, civil society, the private sector and other partners. And we have identified senior staff within the organization with both the technical and political expertise to take this forward. These two projects will be driven very aggressively over the next couple of years and will be evaluated with the eventual aim of integration into the next strategic plan process. I would like to add that all of the organizational changes I have mentioned this morning are cost-neutral and will benefit our programming, especially UNFPAs field operations, which remain our key business. As a field organization, we must push implementation of our strategic plan and accelerate our efforts in the final stretch towards the MDG deadline. To this end, we are reassigning senior staff both at headquarters and in the field so that we can bring about the change that Member States expect and that will enable us to deliver more effectively in the years to come. Operationally, the organization is welcoming new ideas and new leaders, while benefiting from existing strengths and capabilities. We have strengthened our work to undertake audits, investigations and evaluations, and you have before you UNFPAs revised oversight policy. We will continue to promote a culture of ethics, integrity and mutual respect. There is no place in UNFPA for mismanagement, waste or fraud. Managers at all levels must lead with excellence and combine creativity with results. Managing change requires a blend of strong commitment, excellent judgment, intuition, and insight into motivating teams. This will ensure our achievements are not episodic, or fleeting, but rather are sustained and long-lasting. Mr. President,I have already spoken to some of the challenges we face in the area of humanitarian response. Fortunately, thanks to the generous support of our donors, we have been able to scale up our efforts considerably, particularly on gender-based violence. But we still believe we can do better.You have before you some considerations that will enable us to scale up our humanitarian response more quickly. Unfortunately, conflicts, natural disasters and other humanitarian crises are increasing and growing more complex. To be able to better predict and respond to emergencies, UNFPA will conduct a strategic review of our humanitarian response to ensure that we are maximizing our capacity to build resilience within countries. We hope to be able to report more to the Board on this at the Annual Session in June. Mr. President,The world is changing, the UN is changing and UNFPA must change, too. These changes will help us be more dynamic and responsive, and deliver stronger results. We believe that they will re-energize the organization and make us more fit for purpose as we enter the post-2015 arena. I am excited about the future of UNFPA. The universality of the Sustainable Development Goals and their basis in human rights put inequality at the centre of our efforts. As the UN system faces the challenge of blending individual agency mandates to best serve all people, UNFPA has a critical role to play. We know about the power of people to drive sustainable development. Cairos integrated, comprehensive agenda has much to offer as a guide for future action. A UN system that works together to support a holistic development agenda works best for countries and people. UNFPA is firmly committed to working with our UN partners to take Delivering as One to the next level. The Standard Operating Procedures provide a practical means of implementation for the post-2015 development agenda and can accelerate our collective efforts. UNFPA will continue to drive collective change. We count on your support to help hold every UN agency accountable for advancing integration and coherence of policy, programme, funding and business operations. We also count on you to help create the enabling environment for further coherence through your policy and funding decisions. Working together as one UN family we can unleash the power of people to build the future we want. Progress depends on reaching the poorest, and that takes knowledge, skills, technology and infrastructure. At the same time, development must be grounded in human rights and core values that apply to all people, everywhere.We are committed to walking on these two legs  supporting practical operations as well as universal norms and values. When we speak with one voice  and on difficult issues we are sometimes the only voice!  people listen. (And believe me, we at UNFPA know about difficult issues!) Together we can do more, we can do better, and we can deliver on our promise to the worlds people. Mr. President,Martin Luther King once said, Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. It matters that every day 37,000 girls are forced into marriage and expected to have a child while they themselves are still children. It matters that, in some places, a girl is more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than to complete her education. It matters that an estimated 225 million women who want to avoid pregnancy are not using an effective contraceptive method. It matters that one in seven new HIV infections occurs among adolescents aged 10 to 19 years. It matters that one woman in three will suffer violence at the hand of an intimate partner in her lifetime. And we at UNFPA will not be silent. We will not be silent because every life matters. Because human rights matter. According to an Oxfam report released last week, the richest 1 percent are likely to control more than half of the globes total wealth by next year. And that matters, too. Inequality is not just bad for individuals, but for society as a whole, as the ICPD beyond 2014 review showed. It threatens social cohesion, empathy and shared responsibility  the fabric of healthy societies. Unequal societies grow more slowly and have a harder time sustaining growth than more equal ones. Mr. President, Ladies and gentlemen,Youve heard me talk a lot over the past four years about how critically important it is to ensure every 10-year-old girl today has the choices, skills and opportunity to reach her full potential tomorrow.When we look at what we do and how we do it, that 10-year-old girl is the why. The efforts we are making to strengthen our operations and have the right people in the right places, the emphasis on leadership and resources  thats the how. The why is that 10-year-old girl. She is who we must be accountable to. She is what matters. Her rights. Her agency. Her future. And we at UNFPA wont be silent. We wont stop until she is able to exercise her rights, realize her dreams, and live in dignity and well-being. That is what matters for individuals, for societies and for our common future. That is how we will build a more equitable, more resilient, more sustainable world. Thank you.   "
NA,"press","14 November 2019","Speech  Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 Closing Ceremony 14 November 2019   Statement by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem at the closing ceremony of the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25. Excellencies, distinguished participants, dear friends: What an incredible three days this has been. Thank you. Nashukuru sana. Energy, excitement, passion! We have all seen and felt that and more this week. We have come together  over 9500 participants from more than 170 countries  with a profound sense of shared purpose. We have learned together and celebrated together; we have engaged one another and shared the common bonds that unite us through music, art and dance. We have explored how we can do better, where we can do better and why we must do better. And, most importantly, we have made commitments. We have held ourselves accountable. We are taking action. Thanks to all of you, we are closer than ever to realizing the clear vision of the ICPD Programme of Action and the Sustainable Development Goals. We have focused all our conversations, all our efforts, and all our energy around a single number and a simple vision: zero. Zero barriers to contraception and reproductive health care. Zero preventable deaths in pregnancy and childbirth. Zero gender-based violence, assault, and abuse. Zero child marriages. Zero cases of female genital mutilation. Zero. Zero. Zero. Zero is closer than ever beforethanks to the Nairobi Summit; thanks to your commitment; thanks to your passion, your resolve and your insistence on fighting for a better future for girls, for women, for everyone, everywhere in the world. And thanks to the leadership of the Governments of Kenya and Denmark in supporting this Summit and championing rights and choices for all  and to the Governments of Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden, and our many private sector partners, for their additional financial support to making these three days possible. Bravo to thedream teamfrom Kenya, Denmark and UNFPAwho burned the midnight oil for months on end to get us to this moment. Above all, thanks to everyone who pledged this week.  The Summit mobilized more than 1250 commitments from around the world, including billions of dollars in pledges from public and private sector partners. More than 160 Member States have made their voluntary commitments so far. This attests to the extraordinary relevance and resonance of this agenda in countries around the globe. The ICPD is alive and well! Countries committed to increasing national health budgets  to expand access to modern contraceptives and to train midwives and other health workers. They committed to greater inclusion, of people with disabilities, of those who identify as LGBTQI, of anyone who has been excluded, so that everyone can access services and enjoy full and equal rights. They committed to pass laws to prevent gender-based violence and to eliminate female genital mutilation. We heard President Uhuru Kenyattas historic pledge to end FGM here in Kenya within this generation. Countries set in motion actions to harness the demographic dividend to grow their economies. Governments promised to include young people in decision-making, truly heeding the call: Nothing about us, without us! To the young leaders and activists here, thank you for challenging us, for inspiring us, for pushing us and for leading us to do more. Ours is an inclusive agenda and this was a unique and inclusive Summit. This strong, broad coalition across countries, continents and cultures is what it will take to get to the job done. Let us move forward now together, to protect and promote the rights of all people, and especially women and girls. This is the great hope for humanity. This is why we march. And why we continue marching. UNFPA will be marching with you every step of the way. We will never lose sight of who we are fighting for. For the past 12 months, all roads have led to Nairobi. But our journey has never been about just these three days. Our march continues. The Nairobi Statement, a transformative, agenda-setting framework, captures the commitments made this week. I am pleased to announce that UNFPA will create a new high-level commission to drive this agenda and our commitments forward. We will draw from the full spectrum of stakeholdersgovernment and the private sector, young people and activists, civil society and philanthropy, among many others. The commission will propose ways to monitor progress on the commitments made here this week, while accounting for all already existing global, regional, and national follow-up mechanisms. Based on the commissions recommendations, UNFPA will regularly report on the 12 global commitments embodied in the Nairobi Statement. Together, we will work to make the next ten years, years of action and results for women and girls, in keeping with the decade of delivery on the Sustainable Development Goals. Together, we will make sure that promises made are promises kept. We know what we have to do, we know what it will cost, and we know why we do it. We do it because women and girls matter. We do it because sexual and reproductive health and rights matter. This is what unites us. And I know we will succeed. The reason I know this is because of what weve done here. Its because of all the young leaders around the world who are counting on us, but not waiting on us any longer, to advance their visions of a better tomorrow. Thank you for calling on us to work harder. To aim higher. To move faster. Because that is what we need to do to realize the world we all want. So now, as we leave Nairobi and return to our countries, we shall answer that call. Because if we succeed, when we succeed, when we keep the promises of Cairo, when we keep the promises we have made here in Nairobi, there is no doubt in my mind that years from now, a new generation of women and girls will look back on what we did here and say: Nairobi is where we made opportunity a reality. Nairobi is where we stopped just talking about rights, and took action to uphold them. Nairobi is where we, at long last, did the work to put a brighter future within reach for generations to come. Lets keep moving forward. Tusonge mbele! No retreat on women rights and choices. We will not back down. We will never give up. Adelante! Forward!"
NA,"press","01 April 2019","Press Release  Countries agree to accelerate action to fully implement historic plan on population and development, emphasising importance to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals 01 April 2019   Agreement at 52nd session of the UN Commission on Population and Development calls for strengthening implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action, adopted 25 years ago in Cairo New York, 1 AprilUN Member States today reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action, adopted at the landmark International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in Cairo in 1994. In a declaration, countries agreed that the full implementation of the Programme of Action is crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 52nd session of the United Nations Commission on Population and Development opened on 1 April at UN Headquarters and is continuing until 5 April. During the Commissions meeting, countries will examine gains that have been made in implementing the Programme of Action as well as the gaps and shortfalls in achieving its goals and objectives. They will also establish how its implementation contributes to achieving relevant Sustainable Development Goals. When we look at targets on poverty in the least developed countries, or on child marriage or people living in urban slums, while the percentage of affected persons may be declining, their number is still rising, cautions Ms. Amina Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General. Important gains and significant shortfalls in the implementation of the Programme of Action According to the reports of the UN Secretary-General, the world has witnessed significant progress in implementing the ICPD Programme of Action, adopted 25 years ago. Examples include greater access to sexual and reproductive health care, reduced child and maternal mortality, increased life expectancy, and advances in gender equality and womens empowerment. While it is right to celebrate our achievements, we must also prepare for a world with a population that is larger, older, more mobile and more urbanized than ever before, notes Mr. Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. Between 1994 and 2019, the total fertility rate fell from 2.9 to 2.5 births per woman. However, fertility levels remain high in sub-Saharan Africa (4.8), Central and Southern Asia (2.4), Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand (3.4), and Western Asia and Northern Africa (2.9). Since 1994, the under-5 mortality rate fell by more than half, from 89 to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births. Yet, a child born in sub-Saharan Africa today is more than 15 times as likely to die before age 5 compared with a child born in the more developed regions. The global maternal mortality ratio, despite significant gains, is still above the target established in 1994. At its core, ICPD is about recognizing that peoples rights, their choices, and their well-being are essential components required to achieve sustainable development, says Dr. Natalia Kanem, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund. Twenty-five years of evidence and practice continue to support this consensus. Access to sexual and reproductive health-care services key for sustainable development Use of modern methods of family planning has risen markedly. Globally, among married or in-union women of reproductive age who express a need for family planning, the proportion for whom such need is satisfied with modern methods of contraception increased from 72 per cent in 1994 to 78 per cent in 2019. Nonetheless, in 44 countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, less than half of womens demand for family planning is being met by use of modern methods. Globally, the birth rate for those aged 15 to 19 declined from 65 births per 1,000 women around 1994 to 44 per 1,000 currently. The highest levels of adolescent childbearing are found in sub-Saharan Africa (101 births per 1,000 adolescent women) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (61). According to UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador Ashley Judd, the keynote speaker, sexual and reproductive health of girls and women are at the heart of poverty eradication and sustainable development. Importantly, the UN reports highlight the importance of ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services for reducing levels of maternal and child mortality. Typically, such policies lead also to a reduction in the birth rate. Improving education quality and coverage and expanding access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services helps countries to reap the potential gains from the demographic dividend. Global population is ageing, with important regional differences in timing and speed In the 25 years since countries met in Cairo, life expectancy has increased substantially. Since 1994, global life expectancy at birth rose from 65 years to 72 years. However, the gap in life expectancy at birth between countries in the more developed regions versus least developed countries, while it narrowed by 7 years since 1994, remains 15 years today. By 2050, the proportion of persons aged 65 years or over is projected to reach 28 per cent in Europe and 23 per cent in Northern America. Many older adults, especially in developing countries, are unable to meet their basic expenses. As the number of older persons continues to grow in all regions of the world, so does the need to address the increased incidence of age-related frailty and the provision of high-quality health care, while enabling individuals to live longer, healthier and more productive lives. Future population growth will be concentrated in urban areas of Africa and Asia Today, 56 per cent of the worlds population resides in urban areas, a share that is projected to increase to 68 per cent in 2050. About 90 per cent of this urban growth will take place in Africa and Asia. Unplanned or inadequately managed urban expansion, together with unsustainable production and consumption patterns, are often accompanied by urban sprawl, increased pollution and environmental degradation. Policies to manage urban growth need to ensure access to infrastructure and social services for all, focusing on the needs of the urban poor and other vulnerable groups for housing, education, health care, decent work and a safe environment. During the current session of the Commission on Population and Development, representatives andexperts from UN Member States, UN entities and civil society will gather to consider the theme, Review and appraisal of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and its contribution to the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The deliberations at the Commission will assist countries in integrating critical population issues during the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, to be organized by the Economic and Social Council, in July 2019. ***** Find out more about the 52nd session of the Commission on Population and Development and follow the plenary session via UN Web TV.

NA,"press","20 July 2018","    Speech  Young People at the Centre 20 July 2018   Generation NowBriefing for Member States Remarks by Dr. Natalia Kanem,UNFPA Executive Director Good morning!Thank you Henrietta,UN Youth Envoy Jayathma,Distinguished Delegates, When I talk to young people, I tell them you are the U in UNFPA. If we want to live up to the ideals of the UN Charter, if we want to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and if we want to build peace, then we have to put young people at the center. We have to embrace young people as equal partners on this journey together. I am pleased to be here today. UNFPA welcomes this initiative, Generation Now. As a member of the Board, I look forward to having the opportunity to guide this effort and move it forward together within and beyond the UN system. We know that young people represent one of the greatest untapped resources for driving the bold and ambitious 2030 Agenda. As the Secretary-General said at the closing of the High Level Political Forum, First, we must mobilize the transformative power of the worlds young people. In September, we will launch the UNs strategy to support and engage young people. Education is essential  as a critical tool for empowerment, for advancing gender equality and decent work for all, and for changing the way we produce, consume and live. All over the world, young people say: Nothing for us, without us! At UNFPA, we have heard, learned and taken this principle to heart. Our partnerships with young people are, and must always be, based on their active and meaningful participation. Looking around, we see that the youth field is evolving fast, and this initiative is a prime example. Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, we have seen movement in all three pillars of the UNs work. The updated Global Strategy for Womens, Childrens and Adolescents Health, designed to support the health SDGs, now explicitly includes adolescents as a major target group. The Security Councils historic resolution 2250 on youth, peace and security recognizes that vital role of youth peacebuilders. The Human Rights Council resolution on youth and human rights puts the focus where it must be. And last month in June, ECOSOC delegates recognized the positive contributions of young people in the humanitarian sector. For UNFPA, working with and for young people has a long-standing tradition. Young people are at the forefront of the ICPD agenda for population and development - at the heart of the UNFPA mandate. UNFPA has been working with and for young people since our inception. Today we welcome this initiative to join efforts to take solutions for young people to scale. And I would like to make a few points about UN reform and system-wide coherence. UNFPA is committed to the 2030 Agenda, and to supporting Member States in achieving the SDGs, in line with the UN Secretary Generals vision for a more effective UN Development System. In this regard, our work, in particular with UNICEF, UNDP and UN Women is guided by the Common Chapter of our respective Strategic Plans. This lays out our joint commitment to plan, implement and enhance multi-stakeholder partnerships to achieve common results together. I would also like to say a few words about the UN Strategy on Youth to be launched this September. The UN Secretary General asked us all to develop a broader agenda to accelerate the participation, improve the well-being and uphold the rights of young people everywhere. The new UN Strategy on Youth represents the unwavering commitment of the United Nations to prioritize young people, and our collective commitment as a UN family to step up our work for and with young people, under the leadership of the Secretary General. The key priorities of the Strategy include: youth engagement, participation and advocacy; solid and healthy foundations; economic empowerment; human rights; and peace and resilience building. The Generation Now initiative, which we will be discussing today, is yet another example of the increasing importance that the UN is giving to young people. We believe that if the Generation Now initiative builds on existing efforts, and takes relevant expertise and evidence into account, it will provide an opportunity to scale up effective programmes that address the pressing concerns and needs of young people. As I stressed, it is absolutely crucial to meaningfully engage young people in the process to ensure their ownership and relevance to their realities. This way, Generation now, can have a multiplier effect. We have already seen this in our joint efforts to end harmful practices such as child marriage and FGM, and gender-based violence, and violence against children. Now as for the role of UNFPA, I would like to stress the importance of addressing the sexual and reproductive health and rights of young people. For this, we must acknowledge our collective responsibility. This is not only important to prevent adolescent pregnancies, and to reduce maternal death and HIV infection. It is also important to promote healthy and respectful relationships that foster gender equality, and young peoples ability to be leaders to achieve the goals set out for Generation Now and the 2030 Agenda. The agency and skills of young people to make informed decisions during their transition from adolescence to adulthood improve health, well-being and development outcomes for young people, their communities and society. Its important to emphasize that there are already a number of initiatives with and for young people, many of them under the leadership, or with strong support by UNFPA. I am talking about the Compact on Young People in Humanitarian Action that UNFPA co-leads with the International Federation of the Red Cross, the Adolescent Health of the Every Woman Every Child Strategy, and youth in peacebuilding as a follow-up to the recommendations of the Progress Study on Youth, Peace and Security, mandated by Security Council resolution 2250.  UNFPA will continue this ongoing work with national governments and partners to increase investment in young people, both as a human rights imperative, and to harness the demographic dividend. Generation Now builds on already strong collaboration between UNFPA and UNICEF. Based on our complementary mandates, our two agencies collaborate on a number of initiatives, including but not limited to: Joint global programmes on child marriage, FGM and gender-based violence in emergencies; Collaboration on HIV Prevention; Joint work at country level for improvement of national data systems, including generation and use of disaggregated data on adolescents; and Collaboration under the new Compact for Young People in Humanitarian Action. We highly value this collaboration, and we look forward to working together to deliver results for the UN Youth Strategy through well-coordinated and coherent work together, avoiding duplication of existing efforts and scaling up our joint efforts. We hope that Generation Now will bring further visibility and resources to our collective work. We look forward to continued collaboration with governments, civil society organizations, youth-led networks, the private sector, and all partners working for and with young people. Allow me to close by inviting each and every one of the worlds treasured young people to heed the words of the great Nelson Mandela: You can start changing our world for the better daily, no matterhow small the action. Thank you and I look forward to our discussion.   "
NA,"press","28 November 2017","Speech  Improving Maternal and Child Health in the Urban Context 28 November 2017   Keynote statement by Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director, at the 14th International Inter-Ministerial Conference on Population and Development, Technical Session on ""Improving Maternal and Child Health in the Urban Context: Sustainable Cities, Human Mobility and International Migration"", Yogyakarta, Indonesia.  Mr. Chair,Distinguished panelists and guests,Ladies and gentlemen, Good afternoon! It is a pleasure to be here with all of you for this discussion on improving maternal and child health in the urban context. And this is closely linked to migration, which often is movement towards cities. First, however, Id like to zoom out a bit and look at some of the challenges related to reproductive and maternal health more generally. Then I will delve into the particularities of the urban and migration contexts. The world has made vast strides over the past few decades. The number of maternal deaths has dropped from over 500,000 in 1990 to around 303,000 today. The chances of a woman dying due to pregnancy and childbirth complications have fallen by about 45%. For the first time in history, more than 670 million women and girls in developing countries are using modern contraceptives. As a result, more than 307 million unintended pregnancies are averted every year. But this progress does not tell the whole story. In most developing countries, the poorest women have the least power to decide whether, when or how often to become pregnant. The poorest women also have the least access to quality care during pregnancy and childbirth. As a result, reproductive health problems remain a leading cause of death and disability for women and girls in the developing world. In the poorest communities, womens status, maternal death, and child marriage rates have seen very little progress in the past 20 years. In fact, in some instances, gains are being reversed. Becoming a mother should be a joyful event for every pregnant woman. It should not be a death sentence. There is still much more that can be done to save the more than 800 women who die every day. For every woman who dies in childbirth, 20 to 30 more suffer disease, infection or injury, such as fistula  a hole in the birth canal caused by obstructed labour. Women with the condition often suffer incontinence, and as a result, often face social isolation and stigma. In many places, adolescent girls and young women lack access to the education, including comprehensive sexuality education, that is so fundamental to their health. They lack agency and autonomy over their own bodies, which prevents them from claiming their human rights. The facts underline the importance and urgency of addressing their needs and protecting their rights. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for 15- to 19-year-old girls worldwide. While the number of new HIV infections overall has stabilized, we see a troubling increase in new infections among adolescent girls and young women in Africa. The poorest women and adolescent girls have the least power to decide whether, when or how often to become pregnant. Contraception is often out of reach for the poor, especially adolescent girls. About 214 million women in developing countries lack modern family planning. It is essential that contraceptive commodities are accessible to all women at the right time, at the right place and importantly, of the right quality. Family planning is a fundamental human right, and essential to achieving the worlds sustainable development goals. Lets turn now to the urban context. Urbanization is a global trend with far-reaching implications for health, education, the environment and the future of our planet. In 1950, only 30 per cent of the worlds population lived in urban areas. Yet today a majority are urban. And it is projected that around two-thirds of the worlds population will live in urban areas by 2050. The individual experience of these macro demographic trends is something UNFPA has thought a lot about, as we combat conventional wisdom on the challenges of population, and speak to the importance of investing in the dignity, human rights and capabilities of all people. Urbanization presents a great opportunity for improving reproductive, maternal and child health. Many of the challenges faced by rural populations are less severe in urban areas: Urban dwellers generally have easier physical access to health facilities and health care providers than many rural dwellers. The availability of contraceptives, life-saving drugs and necessary medical equipment is generally greater in urban areas. But the opportunities presented by increasing urbanization do not always translate into major improvements in health outcomes. The face of inequality is increasingly an urban one. Too many urban residents grapple with extreme poverty, exclusion, vulnerability and marginalization. Poor people often reside in remote or peripheral parts of cities, often in dense informal settlements or slums. Many people in slums lack ready access to health facilities. Others rely on paying private, unregulated providers for health services that are free in rural areas. In some urban slums, poor women have fertility rates closer to those of rural women. The urban poor often face risky and unhealthy living conditions, such as heavy pollution or high vulnerability to disasters. Adolescents and young people, who are disproportionately represented among migrants to cities, may benefit from urbanization, but also face many of the challenges just described. Urbanization can bring heightened risks of gender-based violence, including sexual exploitation and abuse, particularly for poor women and girls living in communities with little security or infrastructure. Yet cities also offer opportunities for social mobilization and womens empowerment. For many young people, especially young women, moving to cities is an opportunity to escape traditional patriarchy and experience new freedoms. Urban areas offer greater access to education and health services, including sexual and reproductive health care, promoting womens empowerment and the realization of their reproductive rights. This contributes to significantly reduced fertility in urban areas, changing the trajectory of overall population growth. What is UNFPA doing in urban areas?  At UNFPA we work with governments to take account of urban population projections, to realize the pace of change under way, and plan more effectively. One clear example is encouraging governments to build health systems that account for mobility between urban and rural areas  a distinction that is increasingly blurred as peoples lives and mobility take them back and forth across these boundaries.  UNFPA works: to support sexual and reproductive health in urban slums, to build the capabilities of young people in urban areas, to promote gender equality and the elimination of gender-based violence to support data-gathering about the needs and vulnerabilities of women and young people in urban settings. Lets turn now to migration  both internal and across borders. There over 750 million internal migrants and around 250 million international migrants, roughly 40% more international migrants than in 2000. And again, migration and urbanization are tightly linked since cities are major migration hubs, whether at home or abroad. Young people often move first into urban hubs in their own country, and move abroad if urban opportunities fail them at home.  The world today is increasingly globalized. More people have greater access than ever before to information about prospects and options in new places -- something previous generations lacked. International migration, which continues to increase in scope, scale and complexity, is a key feature of globalization in the 21st century, and an important enabler of inclusive sustainable development. Economic, social, demographic and technological transformations have fueled the increase in population mobility across borders worldwide. Virtually all countries in the world are affected by international migration, whether as countries of origin, destination or transit. Todays adolescents and youth are the most mobile generation of young people in history. More than 600 million young people aged 10-24, a group larger than the entire population of the European Union, live in fragile and conflict-affected settings. And more than half of the worlds refugees today are less than 18 years old. These young people are facing the challenges of displacement at a time of intense cognitive, physical and social development. One of the most significant changes in migration patterns in the last half century is that more women are migrating on their own than ever before. Women now constitute almost half the international migrant population, and in some countries, as much as 70 or 80 per cent. Since women migrants frequently end up in low-status, low-wage production and service jobs, and they often work in gender-segregated and unregulated sectors of the economy, such as domestic work, they are exposed to a much higher risk of exploitation, violence and abuse. Many youth migrants leave their homes not only to flee persecution and violence, but also to seek educational, economic and life opportunities. The vulnerabilities they experience in transit need more detailed attention in order to understand and address their needs. Sexual and reproductive health can be compromised during the journey, not only due to inaccessibility of information and services, but also because of risks and potential exploitation en route to their destination. What is UNFPA doing in Migration? At UNFPA, we are committed to protecting the safety, dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their migratory status, at all times. While we focus a great deal on protecting those in transit, the ultimate goal is to ensure that people are choosing, rather than being forced, to migrate. In keeping with the values of the International Conference on Population and Development Programme of Action, UNFPA promotes a people-centred, humane, dignified and gender-responsive approach to the treatment of all persons in their countries of origin, transit and destination. We work at global, regional and country level in three major areas relevant to migration: by addressing the drivers of migration, especially for adolescents and youth, through our development work and leadership on the demographic dividend; by providing protection to those in transit through our humanitarian work; and by advocating for including core migration census questions in the 2020 census round to ensure better estimates of those in transit. In all contexts, UNFPA works to ensure safe birth, safety from fear and sexual violence, and access to contraceptive services. We have set our sights on achieving three transformative goals by 2030: An end to preventable maternal deaths, An end to unmet demand for family planning, and An end to violence and harmful practices against women and girls. What is UNFPA doing to help prevent maternal deaths? UNFPA works at all levels to promote universal access to sexual and reproductive health care and rights, including by promoting international maternal health standards and providing guidance and support to health systems. Our Maternal Health Thematic Fund supports 39 countries with a high burden of maternal death. Since it started in 2008, this work has helped prevent 92,000 maternal deaths in those countries. Our programmes emphasize capacity development in maternal care, especially the strengthening of human resources and emergency obstetric and newborn care facilities and networks. Since 2009, UNFPA has supported more than 600 midwifery schools, educating more than 80,000 midwives in countries with high rates of maternal death. These midwives could help more than 14 million women give birth safely each year. UNFPA also supports the implementation of maternal death review and response systems, which help officials understand how many women are dying, why, and how to respond. The UNFPA-led Campaign to End Fistula currently provides more than half of all fistula repairs globally. UNFPA has supported more than 85,000 repairs since 2003, with more than 15,000 surgeries in 2016 alone. What is UNFPA doing to end unmet demand for family planning? UNFPA works with communities to understand their needs and ensure service delivery is appropriate. Further, engagement with local communities and religious leaders ensures a positive environment for family planning. UNFPA is the biggest provider of donated, quality-assured contraceptives worldwide. UNFPA adheres to WHO prequalification standards for quality reproductive health commodities. In many of the priority countries where we work, our UNFPA Supplies programme is the only, or one of very few, external sources of support for procurement of contraceptives. In 2016, contraceptives provided by UNFPA had the potential to prevent 11.7 million unintended pregnancies, 3.6 million abortions, and 29,000 maternal deaths. Leaving no one behind When we speak of reaching those left furthest behind, women and girls affected by conflict, displacement or violence are among the most compelling examples of who we are talking about. Rohingya refugees fleeing into Bangladesh have reported horrific stories of sexual violence, and UNFPA-supported safe spaces and mobile clinics are providing lifesaving medical services, psychosocial counselling and other services. In South Sudan, poor pregnant and breast-feeding women who barely had any access to life-saving maternal health care suddenly found themselves with no care at all as deadly clashes near the Ugandan border drove tens of thousands of people from their homes earlier this year. Across the border, a UNFPA-supported clinic provided a range of life-saving reproductive health services and access to antenatal care, safe delivery services and postpartum care. Gender-based violence and harmful practices, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation, are human rights violations that rob women and girls of their futures and undermine their health and well-being. Responding to violence against women in development and humanitarian settings, urban or migration contexts, is a priority for UNFPA. Our programmes promote the right of all women and girls to live free of violence and abuse. In a community on the outskirts of Cairo, for example, a UNFPA-supported programme helps vulnerable women stand up for themselves. They learn to use their voice as a weapon, to defend themselves and to step outside with confidence. Dont be afraid or hesitate, the instructor Amany Abdel-Aal tells them. It is your right. The right to a world of safety and dignity is theirs, too. That is the world UNFPA and our partners are working to build."
NA,"press","31 August 2022","Speech  Statement of the Executive Director to the Second Regular Session of the Executive Board 2022 31 August 2022   Greetings! As we begin, I invite you to view a video weve prepared.  Madam President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, Dear colleagues, dear friends, I am pleased to be here with you for this Second Regular Session of the Executive Board. I thank the President and the rest of the Bureau for all their support and guidance in preparing for this session. May I note also that once again our meeting takes place on August 31st, the International Day for People of African Descent. It is a reminder to all of us to look below the surface and beneath the averages, to celebrate diversity, to speak up  against racism and discrimination, and to stand up  for equality, justice and development for all. The imperative to leave no one behind assumes new urgency this year. As you heard, the world stands on the threshold of reaching a population of 8 billion, a milestone expected in mid-November. Good news  increased life expectancy and reduced infant and maternal mortality are the result of reductions in poverty and remarkable advancements in healthcare. This is also a moment that calls for action and solidarity, for humanity to find solutions to the challenges we face  from Covid, conflict and climate change, to food insecurity and poverty, to the roll-back of progress on womens rights in many countries. We can only tackle these challenges together  beginning with people-centred population policies, with sexual and reproductive health and rights at their core. After all, the resounding consensus of all Member States gathered at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo was to support governments to confront their demographic challenges by enhancing rights and choices and investing in the capacity of all people. This vision remains at the heart of all we do at UNFPA even as we adapt to a changing world. Demographic diversity is the current world reality with sweeping implications for societies and economies  with low fertility and ageing in some countries and rapid population growth in others. Unfortunately, we know from experience that population concerns  whether about a population boom or about a shrinking population  too often devolve into fights over womens bodies and attempts to undermine their rights and agency. To this I say: not on our watch. We cannot allow womens health and rights to be used as political footballs.  Earlier this month, sadly, we lost an icon of the sexual and reproductive health and rights movement, Dr. Nafis Sadik, former UNFPA Executive Director and architect of the ICPD Programme of Action. Addressing the Beijing Womens Conference in 1995, she said: The first mark of respect for women is support for their reproductive rights. Reproductive rights involve more than the right to reproduce. They involve support for women in activities other than reproduction, in fact liberating women from a system of values which insists that reproduction is their only function. With so much at stake, UNFPA will continue to push forward to achieve our Three Zeros and to provide hope for that ten-year-old girl in a refugee camp, in a slum, in rural poverty. Inspired by this vision and Dr. Sadiks legacy, UNFPA is helping governments anticipate and build resilience to demographic change. Right now, more than 80 UNFPA programme countries are racing to complete the 2020 census round after COVID delays, and we are working with national statistical departments and partners to ensure high-quality censuses that meet international standards.  We encourage governments to confront demographic challenges not through fewer choices, but rather through more options. All of us want every girl to be able to stay in school, avoid early marriage and childbearing, and gain the skills she needs to succeed. We want her parents to have the number of children they want and can support. We want her mother to receive the care she needs to give birth safely. And we want every young person to be educated, empowered and employed. These are critical investments in the future we all want. If we make the right investments now, 8 billion people could mean 8 billion opportunities to build more peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable societies. Access to sexual and reproductive health is a precondition for women and girls to take control of their bodies and chart their own destiny. Yet, more than 200 million women and adolescent girls still cannot readily access contraceptives they want. Far too many women are still unable to participate fully in society. Young people are fast approaching a quarter of the worlds population. Yet over 175 million young people in low-income countries cannot read a full sentence. So, this is a time for action, for governments, the United Nations system, civil society, the private sector and others to invest in equal rights and opportunities for all. The 8 billion population milestone, and the 30-year review of the International Conference on Population and Development, ICPD30, coming up in 2024, offer opportunities to raise awareness and to accelerate progress on sexual and reproductive health and rights.  Madam President, Recently, Small Island Developing States came together for the Wadadli Action Platform meeting in Antigua and Barbuda. SIDS are literally on the frontlines of the climate crisis  a bellwether for the challenges to come globally and a source of valuable lessons learned. UNFPA is committed to helping SIDS build on their experiences to increase resilience to current and future challenges. This includes integrating age-appropriate life skills sexuality education into school systems and community-led programmes. This equips young people to make healthy choices and to visualize themselves as future leaders. Quite remarkably, Antigua and Barbuda cut their teen pregnancy rate by half in recent years, with tremendous social and economic benefits. How did they do it? By reaching out to girls, boys, parents, teachers, religious leaders and communities. By connecting evidence, policy and practice in the implementation of their National Action Plan to Reduce Adolescent Pregnancy. This September, led by the Secretary-General, world leaders will make their commitments for transforming education. UNFPA urges countries to recognize the irreplaceable impact of age-appropriate, timely life skills and comprehensive sexuality education for preventing gender inequalities, HIV, early and unintended pregnancy, and harmful practices, and for unleashing the power of young people to transform their countries and our world. Such programmes increase the confidence of young people so that they can support each other to make good decisions that strengthen them in later life. That is why UNFPA works to foster intergenerational dialogue and nurture young peoples leadership in humanitarian, development and peacebuilding action. Also very important are our efforts to engage men in changing harmful gender norms. Sexual and reproductive health is not just a womens concern. Boys and men need information and the skills to navigate healthy sexual lives and develop gender-equitable attitudes and a commitment to consent and respect.  Distinguished Board members, In response to multiple and intersecting crises, UNFPA is more and more frequently called upon to rush in, usually within the first 48 hours, to provide humanitarian assistance, which we are doing in more than 60 countries. Afghanistan remains in deep economic and humanitarian crisis. Despite the challenges, in the past 12 months, UNFPA reached more than 4.3 million people. We delivered lifesaving reproductive health services and psychosocial support through family health houses, mobile and static clinics, and mobile health teams. However, less than a third of our 2022 appeal for Afghanistan has been met so far, leaving a funding gap of US$172 million. In Ukraine, six months since the war began, already UNFPA has delivered 97 metric tons of sexual and reproductive health supplies and reached more than 6 million people with protection and health services. More than a hundred mobile psychosocial support teams are now operating in Ukraine, bringing support to gender-based violence survivors in 21 regions. The overall humanitarian situation in Ethiopia has deteriorated significantly since the beginning of the year. More than 25 million people in the country are estimated to need humanitarian assistance, nearly three quarters of them women and girls. And the conflict in northern Ethiopia is fueling sexual violence against women and girls. In June alone, UNFPA and our partners reached more than 25,000 individuals with reproductive health services and distributed reproductive health kits to support more than 1 million people affected by conflict. We are also providing multipurpose cash support to gender-based violence survivors. Somalia is facing widespread displacement, food insecurity, and increasing poverty, with millions of people at risk of famine. Women and girls continue to pay the highest toll. This year, an estimated 7.7 million Somalis need humanitarian assistance and protection. Of those, nearly 4 million are women of reproductive age.  To align with the humanitarian IASC system-wide scale up, UNFPA is expanding its capacity to deliver integrated sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence services at health facilities, mobile clinics, and GBV one-stop centres. In Somalia alone, UNFPA urgently needs US$130 million to provide gender-based violence protection services, reproductive health services for nearly 2 million women and girls, and to meet the needs of over 300,000 newly displaced individuals. Somalia risks becoming one more forgotten emergency. And let us remember emergencies elsewhere, from Yemen to Haiti to Syria and beyond. The devastating floods in Pakistan remind us that more people need humanitarian assistance than ever before, and without adequate and flexible funding, these needs will go unmet. As a global community we need to do more to address lifesaving needs and to build resilience. In June, UNFPA and WHO launched a Sexual and Reproductive Health in Emergencies Task Team, as part of the Global Health Cluster. UNFPA is leading this effort because sexual and reproductive health services must be integral to every humanitarian response. They are a must, not a nice-to-have. Over the past two years, the need for gender-based violence response in humanitarian settings increased by 120%, but only 20% of these needs are funded. We are working with partners to address this gap and to strengthen GBV prevention and response across the humanitarian system, including increasing funds available for local women-led organizations. We ask for your support. I count on your support. UNFPA also continues working to address gaps in humanitarian supply chain management and other bottlenecks through regional prepositioning, product updates, and increased staff capacity.  Madam President, As I pointed out in our last session, UNFPA has committed to the highest standards of accountability and transparency. We are making sure that commitment is reflected in our work and deeply embedded in our organizational culture. We also take seriously our accountability to the women, girls and communities we serve, who depend on us to deliver on the promise of Cairo and on the Sustainable Development Goals. And we know full well that our ability to deliver for that 10-year-old girl depends upon transparency and accountability  to the Executive Board and Member States and to all our partners  and the trust and confidence they place in us as a result.  As part of our commitment to oversight, UNFPA continues to reinforce zero tolerance for all forms of wrongdoing. Over the years, we have deepened our investments in our audit and investigation, evaluation and ethics offices, whose independence we value and respect and whose advice and recommendations strengthen us as an organization. As such, we welcome the recent report assessing the independence of the UNFPA Office of Audit and Investigation Services.We are pleased that the assessment reconfirms thatindependence. We welcome the suggestions to strengthen its independence further and will keep the Board apprised as we move forward in response. With respect to protection from sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment, we have taken important steps, and we are working to increase trust and to empower those experiencing or witnessing abuse to speak up. Progress will depend, in great part, on further bolstering a speak-up culture across the organization and, led by myself and the two Deputy Executive Directors, we are firmly committed to doing so. I have announced a new Enterprise Risk Management policy and institutional set-up that incorporates best practices both to help management take risk-informed decisions and to equip and empower our staff more holistically with the tools and knowledge they need. Our internal controls and risk management will be further automated and improved with the introduction of the new Enterprise Resource Planning system (Quantum), which, as we recently informed the Board, will now be launched in January 2023. I thank the Board for your support of this once-in-a-generation exercise, which will help UNFPA and our allied agencies become even more effective and efficient. This is in keeping with our continued strong support of UN development system reform to enable more effective system-wide assistance to countries to advance the ICPD agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals and Our Common Agenda.  Madam President, Allow me to express the immense gratitude of UNFPA to our partners for their generous contributions, which enable us to deliver lifesaving services to those in urgent need. While we can all be proud of what we have achieved together, this is no time for complacency. Getting to zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices by 2030 will take innovative thinking, partnerships and financing. It will also require that we continue to invest in development results even as we respond to emergencies. As you can imagine, I am pleased to report that, once again, UNFPA had its strongest financial performance to date last year, 2021, reaching US$1.464 billion, well above our Strategic Plan targets. Yet, the funding picture remains mixed. On a positive note, we saw growth in our non-core revenue, thanks to continued support from steadfast donors, and increases in funding from programme country governments, international financial institutions, private sector foundations, and for humanitarian assistance. We are building on these efforts. For example, the UNFPA Supplies Partnership, one of our main vehicles for expanding contraceptive access and choice, is supporting governments to mobilize increased domestic resources for sexual and reproductive health. Already, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo are making use of our new matching fund, which complements domestic contributions for family planning commodities and maternal health medicines. The largest single source of funding to UNFPA continues to be UN pooled funds and other UN entities, demonstrating our commitment to working with partner agencies. Funding from international financial institutions grew to US$73 million, thanks to top-ups to the Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend programme, SWEDD, and new contributions in Bangladesh. During a recent visit to Bangladesh, some Board members saw how UNFPA is implementing World Bank funding to support health facilities at all levels, from community clinics to the district hospital and beyond. Humanitarian funding reached nearly US$350 million in 2021, representing one-third of UNFPA non-core revenue. UNFPA core funding, however, did not increase. The overall decline in the ratio of core to non-core funding is a growing concern and puts our global impact and progress towards our Three Zeros in peril. I appeal to Member States to remember their commitments to the Funding Compact. I encourage all Member States to please contribute to UNFPA core funding as an expression of your support for our ICPD mandate and for multilateralism. While I expect UNFPA will be able to meet its targets this year, I cannot be certain that we will be able to match 2021 funding levels. We are ever more concerned about how global economic stressors will impact 2023 funding. We call on Member States to protect UNFPA funding levels and to meet official development assistance commitments. UNFPA is facing increasing need around the world. Even as we strive to expand our funding base, let us remember that core resources provide the bedrock for our work. Now more than ever, we rely on Member States support and your commitment to provide the flexible funding needed to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls. We count on your early payments to core resources to enable us to plan and deliver efficiently. UNFPA recently announced the winners of our first-ever Joint Innovation Challenge. Ten women-headed social enterprises were selected, pitching innovations ranging from a portable system to detect potentially deadly pre-eclampsia in pregnancy to a board game that tells players about sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. Financed by UNFPAs Equalizer Innovation Accelerator Fund and implemented in cooperation with the World Intellectual Property Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, and the International Trade Centre, the 10 winners will receive equity-free investments to take their solutions from pilot stage to scale. The Accelerator Fund continues to grow its base of strategic supporters, with the pharmaceutical company Bayer recently becoming the first business to join the Fund. In Dhaka, UNFPA showcased some of the innovations under way there to the Executive Board. In partnership with the World Food Programme, we use blockchain technology to deliver food, menstrual supplies and relevant information to women and adolescent girls. Our next step? Scale up. That will include innovative financing to reach even more women and girls. As always, we remain mindful of the need for due diligence and risk assessment.  Madam President, UNFPAs people are key to our ability to deliver results and to support governments in developing policies, plans and capacity to ensure the sustainability of those results. We aim to attract and retain high-calibre staff and to foster an inclusive workplace culture. We build upon principles of trust, respect, teamwork, commitment and accountability, imbued with a spirit of innovation. The 2021 global staff survey showed that UNFPA staff are highly engaged. They are committed. They understand and are proud to contribute to UNFPAs mandate, often going above and beyond the call of duty. We are aware that the survey also pointed to areas for improvement, including strengthening work-life balance, and enhancing learning and development. UNFPAs new People Strategy, co-created with the participation of over 600 UNFPA personnel, will directly respond to these issues, and is borne from our recognition that staff are at the core of everything we do.  Allow me to welcome the three Regional Directors who are the latest members of our senior management team: Ms. Florence Bauer, Eastern Europe and Central Asia; Ms. Lydia Zigomo, East and Southern Africa; and Ms. Laila Baker, Arab States. They bring impressive experience to UNFPA, and I look forward to their contributions. I would also like to acknowledge Mr. Harold Robinson, Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, who is retiring in the coming weeks. We were fortunate to have his leadership and the leadership of Dr. Luay Shabaneh in the Arab States region in recent years. And I thank Ms. Giulia Vallese of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region and Dr. Bannet Ndyanabangi of the East and Southern Africa region for their able service as Regional Directors ad interim.  Madam President, I am now pleased to turn the floor over to Ms. Argentina Matavel Piccin, Regional Director for West and Central Africa to provide a snapshot of UNFPA activities in the region. Obrigada, Argentina. We appreciate your leadership and the accomplishments of the West and Central Africa team.  Madam President, Distinguished Board members, As the Sustainable Development Goals progress report makes amply clear, we need to do much more  and faster. The 2030 Agenda and humanity itself are in danger. Sexual and reproductive health and rights are the foundation upon which womens full participation in their societies is built. If a girl stays in school, she acquires skills that will raise her lifetime earnings, benefiting her children and future generations, increasing her resilience, and reducing vulnerability to violence, various forms of inequality, and climate-related shocks. Lets give women and young people the power and opportunities to drive change, determine the course of their own lives and transform their communities, countries and our world. With the right investments, 8 billion people could mean infinite possibilities for building the more just, equitable and sustainable future we all desire. The time to act is now. I look forward to our interaction. Thank you."
NA,"press","04 April 2014","Speech  Human Progress and Sustainability for All 04 April 2014   Opening Remarks by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin at the High-Level Debate on ICPD Beyond 2014 As prepared for delivery High-Level Interactive Debate on the ICPD Beyond 2014 andHuman Progress and SustainabilityOpening Statement byDr. Babatunde Osotimehin, UNFPA Executive DirectorNew York, 4 April 2014 Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, We are here today to discuss human progress and sustainability  the concepts that define the challenges and opportunities of development for every individual and household, for societies, and for the world as a whole. This is a crucial time in the evolution of the global development agenda. The MDGs are coming to an end; new sustainable development goals are being defined, and amidst these two processes is an ongoing agenda that is vital to both: the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action. As we head into the Commission on Population and Development next week, and as we prepare for the Special Session of the UN General Assembly in September, how we carry forward the Programme of Action, and ensure that its core concepts and gains feed into the Post-2015 agenda, will shape the very nature of human progress and sustainability in all of its dimensions.ICPD 1994 The 1994 Cairo Programme of Action reflected remarkable consensus among 179 countries that increasing social, economic and political equality, and protecting womens and girls human rights, is the basis for individual well-being, sustained economic growth and sustainable development. The Programme of Action charted a course that truly brought together the two aspects of development we are discussing today: human progress and sustainability. By refusing to pit collective aims against each individuals rights, dignity and capabilities  and instead stating that sustainability could only be built on a foundation of dignity and rights  the Programme of Action represented a true paradigm shift. And the evidence of the review of 20 years of implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action overwhelmingly supports that vision. Fewer women are dying in pregnancy and childbirth. Maternal mortality worldwide fell by nearly half between 1990 and 2010. More women have access to education, work and political participation. More children, girls in particular, are going to school, with primary school enrolment rates approaching 90 per cent. And nearly 1 billion people have advanced out of extreme poverty  all while the global total fertility rate fell by 23 per cent. Human Rights Yet the review also underscores the challenges we continue to face. The PoA reaffirmed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  in particular that all people are born free and equal in dignity and rights and are entitled to all human rights without distinction of any kind. But the results of the ICPD Beyond 2014 review show that the realization of dignity and human rights remains far from universal. Major gains have been made in the elaboration of human rights related to the ICPD agenda, and in developing accountability systems to ensure that people know their rights and have a means of realizing them. Yet for far too many, human rights remain abstract, disconnected from the marginalization and exclusion they face  and these same people are often excluded from the systems in place to help them realize their rights. When we think of extending ICPD, what we must carry forward is the recognition that human rights  particularly womens and girls  are the basis of development, fully interlinked with and mutually dependent on well-being, dignity and opportunity. Inequalities Whether due to extreme poverty and rising economic inequality, lack of equitable access to life saving health services, lack of true gender equality in any society, or ongoing discrimination and marginalization, many have been left out of development gains, to the detriment of all. These gaps have demonstrable costs. For inequality, diversion of the vast majority of the worlds wealth  80 per cent to just 8 per cent of adults  limits resources for poverty reduction and sustained growth. High inequality limits political access where assets equal influence, and it reduces social cohesion, upward mobility, empathy and shared responsibility. Gains for women in education and the labour force have helped generate economic booms in many countries; yet continued gender inequality holds back women, families and societies, and the scourge of gender-based violence haunts every society. Lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, drives, and is driven by, gender inequality. It denies girls and women the ability to stay healthy, delay marriage and pregnancy, stay in school, and make decisions that define the course of their lives. 800 women still die every die giving life. And those at gravest risk are poor, marginalized or excluded, primarily in the poorest countries but also in the pockets of vulnerability that persist in wealthier countries. Women in the developed world have only a 1 in 3,800 lifetime risk of dying of maternal causes; while in sub-Saharan Africa, the risk is 1 in 39. A growing body of research shows that discrimination and marginalization have great costs to individuals in their health and productivity, as well as to society. And where intolerance is present, it is often directed towards multiple groups, not just one. We must no longer allow the divisions between us to grow, or to stand in the way of human progress for all. Young people We now have the largest generation of young people the world has ever seen. In Africa, over 30 per cent of the population is between 10 and 24, and will remain so until perhaps 2035. Yet lack of access to sexual and reproductive health and rights is holding back the worlds young people, creating a cascade of challenges for them and for their societies. Worldwide, more than 15 million girls age 15 to 19 years give birth every year  one in five before they turn 18. Pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death among adolescent girls 15-19 in low- and middle-income countries. Nine out of 10 adolescent pregnancies take place in the context of early marriage. And for millions of girls, early marriage and childbearing spell the end of education. Gains in primary education are a great success, yet quality education remains a massive challenge, and progress in secondary, tertiary and vocational schooling, where the skills and resources for lifelong success are made, lags far behind. And what do young people face when they leave school? All too often: unemployment. Young people make up 40 per cent of the unemployed globally. The world must create 600 million new, good jobs over the next decade to fill this gap and account for the young people who will enter the labour market. We know more and more about these issues because the voices of young people are demanding our attention. Their participation is crucial for getting any development framework right  and for making it happen on the ground. Yet among young people, one voice in particular goes unheard  the voice of the adolescent girl. The review shows that we know the least about her  her rights, her freedoms, her knowledge of and control over her body. What we do know points to the risks she faces every day. Millions of adolescent girls and young women live in deep poverty. They may be married to a much older or abusive man, working in domestic service or other unsafe occupations, engaged in exploitive sex work. They may be migrants or affected by conflict or disaster  situations in which young women and girls are often at the highest risk of poor sexual and reproductive health, violence and exploitation. In many countries, adolescence and the onset of puberty is a time when life opens up for boys, but closes for girls. Every girl, regardless of where she lives, or her economic circumstances, has the right to fulfil her human potential. How we meet the needs and aspirations of our young people will define the worlds future. It will determine:  whether we reap economic growth from the demographic dividend,  whether our young people are able to benefit from the productivity, health and well-being that come from growing up in equitable, non-discriminatory and inclusive societies,  how societies manage the ageing transition, and  whether urbanization becomes an engine of human progress, with cities that embrace young people in their search for opportunity, social networks and participation.  And broadly, it will determine the prospects for innovation and entrepreneurship that come from a well-educated, healthy, empowered population and which are critical for charting a course to sustainability The ICPD recognized the importance of young people for development. As we consider human progress and sustainability, it is crucial that we do so for and with young people. Conclusion I would like to end by thanking you for participating today; by thanking the global leaders who will reflect on the past and the future in the course of this interactive debate. Your leadership will be critical in ensuring that the evidence gathered over the past two decades informs the global development agenda beyond 2015. Id like to challenge all of us to use this debate as a means of advancing our understanding of human progress and sustainability, so that we can help deliver a world of sustainable development for all.

NA,"press","05 September 2014","Speech  UNFPA: The path forward 05 September 2014    Statement by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin at the Second Regular Session of the Executive Board Excerpt of remarks, as prepared for delivery Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, Colleagues and friends, Ladies and gentlemen, Good morning. Our meeting today comes at a historic moment, as we prepare to mark the 20th anniversary of the groundbreaking International Conference on Population and Development.   UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin highlights key achievements and priorities.Photo credit: UNFPA  Twenty years ago, 179 governments from all regions and cultures recognized that empowering women and girls and advancing gender equality was both a question of human rights and one of the surest paths to improved well-being for all. Twenty years ago, governments called for universal primary education, for universal sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, for major reductions in maternal and child deaths, and for prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. These goals laid the groundwork for the Millennium Development Goals, and we have made real progress. More girls are in school. Fewer women are dying in childbirth. More people are able to exercise their reproductive rights. More women are able to have babies by choice, not chance. Since 1990, the global total fertility rate fell by 23 per cent and nearly 1 billion people have advanced out of extreme poverty. The ICPD review points to much progress over the past two decades, but it also shows that stubborn inequalities continue to leave far too many of us behind and discrimination continues to keep too many from realizing their human rights, including their reproductive rights. Fortunately, armed with the reviews data, we have a better idea of where we need to focus our efforts to complete this unfinished business, face emerging challenges, and accelerate action to fully implement the Cairo agenda. We also know that in order to make progress, in order to advance a universal sustainable development agenda beyond 2015, we must work towards a common understanding of the universality of human rights. Development can only succeed when human rights are respected. This emphasis on the rights of individual women, men and young people underpins the ICPD Programme of Action, guides UNFPAs work and must be the cornerstone of the Sustainable Development Goals. There can be no development without human rights. In just a few weeks, Member States will meet at the highest level during the UN General Assembly Special Session on the ICPD Programme of Action and its follow-up beyond 2014. Our hope is that the lessons learned over the past 20 years will inform their work to define sustainable development goals for the future and that they will keep in mind the most important message of the ICPD  that development is about people, about human well-being, about dignity and human rights. Its about the power of people to find sustainable solutions, the power of people to move from crisis to recovery, the power of people to support each other and uphold human rights, the power of people to be entrepreneurs, and agents of change, the power of people to drive green and inclusive economic growth with benefits that are widely shared across society. Its about resilience  empowered, resilient people building resilient societies. Let me turn now to some of the key areas where we will be focusing our efforts going forward. Path forward As you know, of all the MDGs, we have made the least progress on MDG 5 and its two targets  to reduce maternal mortality and increase access to reproductive health. To address this challenge and ramp up our efforts, UNFPA and its partners, including governments, the United Nations system, civil society and the private sector, recently launched a roadmap aimed at speeding up progress to save an additional 140,000 women and 250,000 newborns and significantly increase access to reproductive health services, including modern contraception, by the end of 2015. UNFPA is also working with partners to reach 120 million women and girls by 2020 with modern contraceptives, as agreed at the 2012 London Family Planning Summit. We continue to commit around 40 per cent of our programme resources to family planning, so that individuals and couples can decide whether to have children, and if they choose to do so, when and how many. In 2013, this enabled us to help 95 countries improve the availability and choice of contraceptives. Fulfilling the promise of youth Part of this commitment means working to reach those with the least access, including young people, particularly adolescent girls, and the most marginalized, disadvantaged and under-served populations, including women and girls in crises. The largest generation of adolescents is now entering their sexual and reproductive lives, as well as their economically productive lives. Yet lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services and information, including contraception and comprehensive sexuality education, continues to limit young peoples opportunities. Early marriage and early pregnancy jeopardize the health and well-being of far too many adolescent girls, closing the door to education and opportunities for a better life. Too many girls continue to be subjected to gender-based violence and harmful practices such as female genital mutilation  heinous violations of their human rights. Violations compounded by the fact that far too few of these girls, particularly the poorest and most marginalized, have access to the support, services and protection they so desperately need. To take just one example of the high costs they pay, although HIV-related deaths are down overall, among adolescents they are actually going up and the rates of increase are highest for girls. Every young person has the right to health, to education, and to live free from violence, coercion and discrimination. Every young person deserves the skills they need to compete in the labour market. Every young person deserves equal opportunity, to have a fair chance to reach their innate potential. Every young person has the right to sexual and reproductive health, to reproductive rights, to know how to protect themselves and their futures. And UNFPA will continue stand by the worlds young people, particularly the most marginalized adolescent girls, and promote their access to youth-friendly services and information, to education and skills development opportunities, and to a voice in decisions affecting them and their societies. Now more than ever, it is time to invest in and unleash the power of young people to create the future we want  a sustainable world where everybody has equal opportunities. Work in crises UNFPAs efforts to reach the most marginalized and unreached extends to our humanitarian work to provide life-saving commodities and services to women and girls under some of the most challenging and dangerous circumstances. As the international community struggles to respond to larger, more complex and frequent emergencies, UNFPA has strengthened its humanitarian response and increased by 50 per cent the implementation of life-saving programmes between 2012 and 2013. UNFPA is currently responding to an unprecedented number of large-scale disasters simultaneously. While we continue to respond to humanitarian emergencies in Syria, Iraq, the Central African Republic and South Sudan, among other crises, we are also working to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health care  including safe deliveries  in countries struggling to cope with the Ebola outbreak. Ebola is devastating health systems and threatening the political, social and economic stability of affected countries and regional security in West Africa. Greater political engagement and resources are urgently needed to help mitigate these risks. UNFPA will continue to support countries efforts, not only in ensuring maternal health services, but also in contact tracing, technical support and social mobilization to support health advocacy strategies and prevent further spread of the disease. Women form the backbone of families and communities. When emergencies strike, their important contributions become even more vital, but their particular needs and vulnerabilities are often overlooked. And, as we have seen tragically in the case of Ebola, women, who bear the burden of care, have been the hardest hit. UNFPA will continue to work to ensure that womens needs are factored into the planning of all humanitarian assistance and that their urgent reproductive health needs are not forgotten. Increasing understanding Let me turn now to another significant focus for us  population data and the use of this data to understand population dynamics  how many people are living today and how population numbers will change, how old people are and how age structures will change, and where people are living and how geographic distribution will change in coming years. Without the systematic collection of population data and use of population projections countries cannot understand and meet the needs of their people or hope to benefit from a potential demographic dividend arising from their changing population structures. This is a critically important area, and UNFPA will continue to assist countries in building their capacity for generating population data, including developing or strengthening civil registration and vital statistics systems, and using this data to guide policymaking and national development strategies. We also stand ready to leverage our partnerships with national statistical offices to advance UN system action in this area. I believe that UNFPA is better equipped than ever to meet the challenges we face and firmly committed to stepping up our efforts and mobilizing the broadest possible support to promote the sexual and reproductive health of all people, to ensure that no woman dies giving life and to enable everyone everywhere to live in dignity and realize their human rights.   "
NA,"press","05 February 2020","    Speech  Statement of the Executive Director to the 1st Regular Session 2020 of the Executive Board 05 February 2020   Statement of UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem to the FirstRegular Session 2020 of the Executive Board of UNDP, UNFPA and UNOPS As we begin, on behalf of UNFPA, I express our solidarity with the people and Government of the Peoples Republic of China and all countries affected by the outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019. UNFPA is monitoring the situation and advising our staff accordingly. Along with the World Health Organization and the rest of the UN system, UNFPA stands ready to lend our support. Mr. President,Distinguished Members of the Executive Board,Colleagues and friends, Good morning! A very happy new year and decade to everyone. Congratulations Ambassador Walton Webson on your election as President of the Executive Board. A warm welcome also to the rest of the Bureau: Ambassadors Georgi Panayotov of Bulgaria, Mansour Al-Otaibi of Kuwait, Valentine Rugwabiza of Rwanda, and Anna Karin Enestrm of Sweden. We look forward to working closely with you in the year ahead. Our deepest thanks to Ambassadors Cho Tae-yul and Cho Hyun of the Republic of Korea and to the outgoing Bureau forguidance and partnership over the past year. 2019 proved to be a momentous year for UNFPA and for the global movement for reproductive health and rights. Its a movement that is alive and well and indeed stronger than ever, as was evident at the highly successful Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 convened by the Governments of Kenya and Denmark together with UNFPA last November. We hope the video provided a taste of the energy, excitement and spirit of inclusivity that made the Nairobi Summit special. The Board will recall that our intention was to mark the 25th anniversary of the landmark International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action, which to this day guides the work of this body and UNFPA efforts in over 150 countries around the world. Even as we strive to be accountable and ever-efficient so that we can deliver on its bold promise to women and girls, even as we adapt to new realities; the ICPD Programme of Action remains our compass. The Nairobi Summit aimed to celebrate progress; to create political and financial momentum to complete the unfinished business of the ICPD Programme of Action within the framework of the 2030 Agenda; and to reinvigorate and expand the ICPD community so that together we have greater impact  and within a 10-year time frame. Women cannot afford to wait another 25 years. The Summit was nota forum for creating new language. The ICPD Programme of Action remains as valid and relevant as ever. The Nairobi Summit was meant to re-energize the movement and secure commitments to accelerate action. Thats why it was imperative to ensure its resounding success. We explored themes of universal access, financing, demographic diversity, ending gender-based violence and harmful practices, and delivering in humanitarian and fragile contexts. These issues speak to the complementarity of the ICPD and 2030 agendas. The Nairobi Statement and voluntary commitments demonstrate global resolve to get the job done. They provide a powerful platform for UNFPA to accelerate the priorities agreed by the Board in our Strategic Plan 2018-2021. We thank Member States from across the globe for contributing to the Summits tremendous success. We had high expectations. The Summit exceeded them: More than 8,000 delegates from 173 countries. More than 1,250 commitments from Heads of State, governments, donors, businesses, non-governmental organizations, civil society and more. Billions of dollars pledged by private and public sector partners. To follow up, I plan to convene a high-level commission drawn from a broad cross-section of stakeholders, to shepherd and give impetus to the Nairobi commitments within existing mechanisms at global, regional and national levels.This will help us to ensure that the next 10 years are indeed a decade of action  and results  for women and girls. There is undoubtedly strong political will to achieve UNFPAs three transformative results and reach zero: zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices. We shall carry this powerful momentum forward as we begin the Decade of Action to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, and, as we proudly celebrate 75 years of the United Nations and 25 years since the Beijing World Conference on Women. The ICPD and Beijing agendas go hand in hand. Gender equality and empowerment depend upon women and girls ability to exercise their reproductive rights. We look forward to even stronger collaboration with you, to capitalize on more than 50 years of UNFPA experience, bringing our know-how to the strong partnership between UNFPA and UN Women on the two Beijing+25 Generation Equality Forums this year. We will engage with our partners to take the work forward, particularly that of the action coalition on Bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive health and rights. To quote Secretary-General Antnio Guterres: Gender equality is fundamentally a question of power Only when we see womens rights as our common objective  will we begin to shift the balance.  On the 20thanniversary of Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, UNFPA is proud to bring our evidence-based research, data and technical assistance to support womens and youth leadership for peace. 2020 is also designated International Year of the Nurse and Midwife. What an excellent way to start this decade of action and delivery!Midwives do deliver  babies, and more. Midwives are the backbone of many health systems, particularly important as UNFPA helps to advance Universal Health Coverage.  Mr. President, Despite considerable progress, there is still a long way to go to get to zero. The good news is that, while there may be resistance in some instances, there is an even stronger push forward. There is demonstrated strong consensus around the world that we can and must accelerate progress to achieve our common goals. UNFPA calls for reinvigorated joint action  because no single entity can do it alone. The Nairobi Summit and related commitments prove that leadership to assure sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights exists at all levels, from Presidents to the grassroots, from refugees to royalty. Support for the ICPD agenda remains strong, and UNFPA remains strong and effective. Midterm Review of Strategic Plan and Integrated Budget The midterm review of the UNFPA Strategic Plan will be presented to the Board in June, to take stock of progress on the three transformative zeros, and to determine where additional support and focus may be required.UNFPA will ensure a transparent process in our discussions with the Board, focusing on key drivers and enablers to scale up and accelerate implementation over the remaining two years, and laying a solid foundation for the next strategic plan from 2022. We also will engage with the Board as we prepare the midterm review of the Integrated Budget. Emerging priorities include risk-based strengthening of our country offices and additional investments in humanitarian activities; independent oversight functions; and resource mobilization and strategic partnerships. UN reform We continue to make progress working with other funds and programmes under the common chapter framework and, more broadly, under the umbrella of UN Development System reform. For UNFPA, delivering better together and moving ahead on UN reform are mainstreamed across all that we do. In response to questions about the price tag for achieving our three transformative results, last year UNFPA brought together leading research institutions to calculate, for the first time ever, the costs and the new investments needed to achieve these ambitious aims. We decisively demonstrated a funding gap of $222 billion US dollars to achieve the three zeros by 2030, and that in comparison thecost of inaction would be immense. Thus, an urgent need to accelerate global efforts on family planning, ending maternal mortality and ending gender-based violence, complemented by increased domestic resources and national action from all stakeholders  government, the private sector, civil society, and individuals. In the years ahead, our focus will be on integration, adaptability, agility, innovation and above all, results. Furthermore, UNFPA undertook an internal survey on UN reform. It indicates a more transparent and collaborative environment with more opportunities for joint initiatives among UN agencies. We are encouraged by the support of resident coordinators for the UNFPA mandate and by their engagement on normative issues. UNFPA remains closely engaged in the regional and multi-country office reviews. We have offered our new costing models and tools to the United Nations system, to be scaled up and adjusted to the needs of those countries covered by multi-country offices. As part of our support to these countries, UNFPA is increasing physical presence; reviewing business model and resource allocations; and strengthening South-South and triangular cooperation. UNFPA has much to offer UN Country Teams in the area of data: data for development, on youth, on harnessing the demographic dividend and to create financing momentum. Results-based management UNFPA is committed to continuously fostering results-based management. We are pleased that several external assessments, such as one by the Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN), found that UNFPA systems perform well. Last year, the Fund asked the independent Evaluation Office to conduct the first-ever developmental evaluation at UNFPA. Developmental evaluations help to identify innovative options in complex, uncertain and dynamic conditions associated with new initiatives or transformational activities. In this case, with the desire of UNFPA to evolve to the next stage of results-based management. The developmental evaluation of results-based management is providing us with real-time evidence, and we are actively incorporating that learning into our work. Humanitarian Mr. President, Our new Humanitarian Office in Geneva along with our humanitarian colleagues based in New York are meeting the ever-increasingneeds of people in emergencies for sexual and reproductive health services, a response to gender-based violence, and mental health care. Our strategic humanitarian priorities for 2020 are to:improvepreparedness and prepositioning, strengthen leadership, and enhance operational capacity. In the past six months, we scaled up the gender-based violence response and reproductive health services provision by specialists in our regional hubs, which provide technical and capacity-building support to our country offices for timely emergency action. Since we last met in September, UNFPA shipped reproductive health kits to serve up to two-and-a-half million people in humanitarian and fragile settings. In 2019, the UNFPA surge team deployed 129 personnel to 29 countries  up 35 per cent from the previous year. Notably, we were among the first responders after Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, and we had a fully functional team on the ground within just 72 hours after Cyclones Idai and Kenneth stormed Mozambique. None of these humanitarian actions would be possible without the tremendous support of Member States for the unique role UNFPA plays. I also acknowledge with gratitudeour colleagues working in hardship settings, who continually provide capable and selfless service to women and girls in their time of need.  Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Protection from sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment remains a key priority for UNFPA and the UN system. With robust tools and procedures now in place, our focus is to ensure that systems work effectively. UNFPA upholds zero tolerance for sexual harassment, abuse of authority, or disrespectful behavior in our workplace. In September, I will be pleased to assume the role of Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Champion on Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) and Sexual Harassment, promoting survivor-centered approaches and increased investment in sustainable, quality service delivery. Funding Mr. President, I am heartened to report that last year UNFPA received record financial support. While we are still counting contributions, combined 2019 revenue currently stands at over $1.3 billion US dollars. I am encouraged to note that for 2019 core funding should exceed our target of $350 million US dollars. Co-financing for 2019 also stands at a record $940 million US dollars. Going forward, UNFPA will continue to collaborate with international and regional financing institutions,in making the case for increased investments in the health and wellbeing of women, adolescents and young people. We are immensely grateful to all our longstanding, consistent donors, without whom our vital programmes would not be able to forge ahead. I also thank programme countries for their increasing contributions. Today, we launch the UNFPA 2020 Core Mobilization Campaign. Our donor partners are proudly listed in the brochures you have before you. We attach great importance to the structured funding dialogues and the UN Funding Compact as vehicles to expand our donor base. We will remain in harmony with other UN agencies in further improving such dialogues and progressing towards fulfilling Funding Compact commitments. In this, further to the 2018 decision, continued guidance from the Board will be essential and we remain at your disposal,counting upon every countrys engagement and support to kickstart the Decade of Action. 2020 Census The 2020 population census round is under way. The aim? To ensure that everyone is counted. With just 10 years to go to transform our world, our efforts must be based on high-quality data and evidence. So far,33 UNFPA programme countries have finished census enumeration, with 46 to follow this year and another 39 countries in 2021. Such a huge undertaking is not without challenges. UNFPA enjoys the trust of government statistical and planning divisions, and we offer all we can by way of strong technical support to governments in these census efforts. The newPopulation Data Thematic Fundwill build much-needed capacity for the modern electronic census and ensure that these data inform development in a timely way. Staff movements Mr. President, I am pleased to welcome back into the UNFPA fold Mr. Harold Robinson, who rejoined the Organization as Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean in October. I also welcome Ms. Leanne Kinsella, who joined UNFPA as Ethics Adviser in October. Finally, I offer our profound thanks to our outstanding Deputy Executive Director (Management), Ms. Laura Londn, who departs UNFPA this month, having made enormous contributions, particularly through her leadership on change management and UN reform. It has been a great pleasure to work with Laura over the past four years. She helped steer the agency skillfully and safely through unforeseen developments, and on occasion difficult times, with her signature level-headedness and optimism. I know I speak on behalf of us all in saying that well miss you, Laura. We wish you the very best in your exciting next chapter. Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, Id like to close with this favorite proverb:The bird soars through the air ... yet its eye is on the ground. As UNFPA soars on the wings of the Nairobi Summit, as we aim ever higher towards our ambitious goals for women and girls, we keep our eyes steadily focused on the ground  upon what is needed to uphold the rights and dignity of the women, adolescent girls, young people and families we serve. Our blueprint for action, based on the UNFPA strategic plan, couched in the SDGs and the ICPD Programme of Action, is clear. We know what we have to do  now, we know how much it will cost, and most of all we knowwhywe do it. Women cant afford to wait another 25 years. Nor should they have to. All eyes, all efforts, and all our energy are fixed on a single number and a simple vision: zero. Zero barriers to contraception and reproductive health care. Zero preventable deaths in pregnancy and childbirth. Zero gender-based violence. Zero child marriages. Zero cases of female genital mutilation. Zero is closer than ever before  thanks to UNFPAs worldwide work on high-quality data and evidence; thanks to the strategic support and unwavering commitment shown by you, our Executive Board; and thanks to our collective resolve and insistence on fighting for a better future for girls, for women, for young people, to not leave anyone behind who is marginalized anywhere in the world. Uplifted and inspired by the galvanizing force of the Nairobi Summit, situated within the ICPD and SDG agendas, I am most confident that together we will make the next ten years, years of results  to transform our world and the lives of the millions of women and girls who depend upon us for action. I thank the Board, and you, Mr. President, for your constant and thoughtful stewardship, and I look forward to our interaction this morning. Thank you.   "
NA,"press","26 February 2007","Statement  Statement at the Commission on the Status of Women 26 February 2007   It is my pleasure to address the opening of this fifty-first session of the Commission on the Status of Women, especially in the presence of the Deputy Secretary-General, with whom we senior officials of the United Nations, commit ourselves to work to ensure that all of us are held accountable for our gender goals. I would first like to congratulate my colleagues in United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), led by Ann Veneman, for  The State of the World's Children 2007: Women and Children - The Double Dividend of Gender Equality  . The title says it all: if we invest in women, we are also investing in children, especially the girl child. And if we invest in the girl child, we are investing in the mother and citizen of tomorrow. Investing in women and girls is one of the best investments a government can make. As I speak, a woman in a developing country is about to give birth. If she and her newborn survive, the family and the community will display pride to count one additional member. Yet, if that member is a baby girl, the course of her life might differ drastically from that of a baby boy. We at UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, welcome the priority theme of this years session: The elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against the girl child. No matter where a girl is born, she should be able to live free of discrimination and violence. She should be able to enjoy respect of her human rights and fundamental freedoms. When they created the United Nations more than 60 years ago, the founders proclaimed their faith in human rights, in the inherent dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women. Over the years, these rights have been elaborated in declarations, plans of action, and conventions, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and they have been articulated in national constitutions and laws. And yet, we are gathered here today because the ideal of every girl living in dignity, in freedom from fear and want, with equal opportunities and equal rights remains out of reach for millions of girls around the world. Today, far too many girls are denied an education. They are married as child brides, their dreams stolen from them before their very eyes. Too many girls give birth before they are ready, putting their lives and the lives of their babies at risk. Far too many girls suffer from gender-based violence. And far too many are infected with HIV. We are gathered here as representatives of the United Nations system, as representatives of government, of civil society and the private sector because we know the realities and want to see greater progress. Discrimination against the girl child is a serious human rights violation that harms all of us, beginning with the girl child herself. Empowering girls through education is a priority. It helps girls build their self-esteem and self-confidence. It builds their capacities to know and fight for their rights. And it gives them lifetime tools to fulfill their aspirations and dreams and become driving forces for development and the real agents of change that our world needs. Yet, today, as many as 55 million girls continue to be left out of formal schooling. Together, we must do more to ensure universal access to primary education and close the gender gaps in secondary education. By doing so, we will reduce poverty and promote gender equality. While the global campaign for Education for All led by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is making progress, we must work together to increase its momentum. Countries leading the way forward are instituting free secondary education, subsidies for girls and incentives for households. UNFPA is committed to promoting universal education and we are committed to education that promotes life skills, equality and human rights, including the right to sexual and reproductive health. Studies show that young people who receive factual and comprehensive information are more likely to engage in healthy and responsible behaviour. Ladies and gentlemen, It is unacceptable that girls in some societies continue to be marginalized and viewed as inferior and less valuable than boys. Girls are often assigned harsh duties without relief. Taking care of younger siblings and other relatives, going to gather firewood and fetch water, cooking and cleaning, learning how to carry heavy loads on the head is the all-day life for many girls living in rural areas. Yet, all over the world, girls are being exposed to new ideas and ways of doing things and many are caught between tradition and change. In response, we must work with parents and leaders in the community to provide supportive guidance and foster inter-generational understanding as girls navigate the new challenges in their lives. We must encourage communities to raise girls and boys to respect each other, to aspire equally to educational and work opportunities and to expect fair and mutually respectful relationships. And we must continue to work with womens and youth groups and civil society, and do more to reach out to boys and men. The values of equal worth, mutual respect, and shared rights and responsibilities must be taught from an early age. Whether it is domestic violence, incest, rape, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, child prostitution and child pornography, trafficking, forced labour, or harmful traditional practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation or cutting, the result is the same: a girl is prevented from exercising her human rights, her dignity is violated and her health and well-being as well as her future are placed in jeopardy. Today, an estimated 82 million girls in developing countries who are now between the ages of 10 and 17 will be married before their 18th birthday. Child marriage puts the health of young girls in danger. In most cases, child marriage results in teenage pregnancy and early childbearing, which in turn puts the young girl at higher risks of maternal mortality, injury and disability. One of the most severe consequences of early childbearing is obstetric fistula. Today, at least 2 million young women and girls in developing countries are affected by obstetric fistula, especially among the most impoverished rural girls who have been forced to drop out school, if they ever had such an opportunity, coerced into early marriage, and lack access to health information and services, especially reproductive health information and services, including family planning. If these girls and women had access to reproductive health services including emergency obstetric care, they would never suffer the devastating condition of fistulaa condition that was eliminated in the wealthiest nations over a century ago. UNFPA is proud of its Global Campaign to End Fistula and the vital support we are receiving from partner countries. I am pleased to inform you that the Campaign has grown from 12 countries in 2003 to 40 countries today. With many partners in these countries, we are making progress and we are committed to making even more. Together with partners, we are also working to end female genital mutilation or cutting. Worldwide, an estimated 100 million to 140 million girls and women have undergone the practice and 3 million girls continue to be at risk each year. We are encouraged by the progress that is underway in more than a dozen countries that have passed laws to make this harmful traditional practice illegal. Thanks to rising awareness, and community leadership and dialogue, increasing numbers of women, men and young people now disapprove the practice. Awareness is also increasing about prenatal sex selection and female infanticide. In some places, a strong preference for sons has led to the elimination of millions of girls, resulting in serious demographic imbalances that have long-term negative social and economic impacts. As a matter of urgency, where this is happening, countries must enact and enforce laws banning sex selection, create community-based networks to advocate against the practice, sensitize health providers and integrate national development strategies, comprehensive measures and incentives that promote the equal value and equal opportunities for girls. We at UNFPA work closely with such countries to ensure that girls are valued and that the practice is banned. Ladies and gentlemen, All over the world, we see how family, community and educational institutions-all charged with a protective mission-often jeopardize the safety of girls. There are many negative manifestations of gender discrimination and violence, not the least of which is a crushing of the human spirit. Another negative outcome is the spread of HIV and AIDS. The role of gender-based violence in increasing the vulnerability of girls and young women to HIV/AIDS must be urgently addressed. Without dedicated efforts, marginalized and disadvantaged girls will continue to bear a rising and disproportionate share of HIV infections. Promoting and protecting the rights of girls also protects them from HIV infection. As we meet today, violence against women and girls, including rape as a weapon of war, is occurring on a massive and devastating scale in conflict and post-conflict situations around the world. Our response has to be commensurate with the problem. This is urgent given the fact that an estimated 40 per cent of child soldiers are girls who were forcibly recruited. Here, I wish to inform you about the success of a UNFPA supported project in Sierra Leone, which is working to empower adolescents and girls affected by the war through various interventions, including the provision of reproductive health and HIV-prevention services and reintegration opportunities. The programme supports women and girls, who suffered abuse and other forms of violence at the hands of warring fractions, and is being implemented by the Women in Crisis Movement, a faith-based humanitarian organization. Ending discrimination and violence against the girl child is a minimal aspiration that should be shared by all of humanity. UNFPA appeals to countries to vigorously enact and enforce laws and regulations that address discrimination and violence against women and girls, and to advance gender equality and human rights, including the right to sexual and reproductive health. The way forward is laid out in internationally agreed instruments such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action. Today in several countries, UNFPA is working within United Nations Country Teams with governments and civil society on national action plans to prevent and address violence against women and girls. As we work together to deliver as One United Nations in support of national development, we must make human rights a priority. I am encouraged by the progress being made to mainstream a human rights-based approach in our work as a United Nations system. UNFPA will continue to champion United Nations reform that puts human rights, including the rights of the girl child, at the centre of the equation and we will work with UNICEF and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and other sister agencies to end discrimination and violence against girls. Today, 89 governments have some legislative provisions that specifically address domestic violence; marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 countries; 90 governments have some form of legislative provision against sexual harassment; and 93 nations have legal provisions against human trafficking. While we express appreciation to those countries that have put in place programmes for women and girls affected by violence, we also urge the governments and parliaments that have adopted laws to ensure their implementation. And we invite all stakeholders, including Governments, civil society, researchers and the international development community to strengthen their efforts in providing evidence-based information on gender-based violence, and preventing and addressing violence against girls and young women. Madam Chair, To conclude, I would like to stress that the world will not reduce poverty and advance human development unless we make the protection and promotion of human rights, including for women and girls, a priority. This priority must be reflected in national development plans, poverty reduction strategies, sector-wide reforms and budgets. We call upon all governments to take all necessary measures and to institute legal reforms to ensure the full and equal enjoyment by the girl child of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take effective action against violations of those rights and freedoms. As the great leader, Nelson Mandela, said: To deny any person their human rights is to challenge their very humanity. Thank you. ***"
NA,"press","10 June 2021","    Speech  Statement of the Executive Director to the Annual Session of the Executive Board 2021 10 June 2021   Madam President,Distinguished Members of the Executive Board,Colleagues and friends, Im pleased to be with you for this annual session of the Executive Board as we continue our very fruitful dialogue and together chart the path ahead for UNFPA in our next Strategic Plan phase, 2022-2025. The plan is a call to action, forged in the midst of a crisis that has forever altered us  as individuals and as a global community. No country has escaped unscathed. The COVID pandemic has tested the bounds of global solidarity and countries commitment to multilateralism, even as it is showing unequivocally that none of us is safe, until all of us are safe. It has exposed huge fault lines in our societies, with the poorest and most vulnerable people, people of African descent, indigenous peoples, older persons, and those with disabilities, hardest hit. Once again, women and girls are bearing the brunt. Many of the consequences UNFPA warned about early in the pandemic are now playing outfrom the global surge in domestic violence, to spikes in child marriage, teenage pregnancy, female genital mutilation, and pregnancy-related complications and death. Our fear is that pandemic-related disruptions could reduce progress towards ending gender-based violence and female genital mutilation by one third over the next decade, and we could see an additional 13 million child marriages. And yet, the reality could have been much worse had UNFPA not sounded the alarm and rallied together with our partners and with countries to mount a timely response. Rising to the challenge, UNFPA ensured that health workers received personal protective equipment and training to provide COVID-19-related services. In 2020, UNFPA reached around 50 million women and young people with sexual and reproductive health services, including 2.5 million migrants, refugees and displaced persons, and we assisted 1.9 million safe deliveries in 42 humanitarian-affected countries. To ensure that shelves were not bare at service delivery points, we strategically prepositioned and regularly monitored stocks of contraceptives and other life-saving supplies. More than half a million women and girls subjected to violence accessed mental health and psychosocial support services. Hotlines that depend on UNFPA support offer a lifeline to those at risk of violence. My annual report highlights the significant results UNFPA achieved in the first three years of our current strategic plan. From 2018 to 2020, UNFPA helped avert nearly 59 million unintended pregnancies, 160,000 maternal deaths, and around 17 million unsafe abortions. More than 350,000 girls were protected from female genital mutilation, and tens of thousands of women and girls suffering from obstetric fistula received treatment. One year into the COVID experience, UNFPA now prepares to transition into the second of our three strategic plans in the homestretch to 2030. I believe there are a number of lessons to be drawn. First, in the words of Secretary-General Antnio Guterres, solidarity is survival. Now is the time to step up international solidarity, not step away from it, including through official development assistance (ODA) commitments and equitable access to vaccines. Second, functioning health systems are essential to our larger freedoms and development ambitions. And we cannot approach health, economic, social, humanitarian and peace interventions separately. We need to do a much better job of living up to the ideals of the 2030 Agenda in this regard. Third, we need to accelerate progress. Even impressive gains can be worryingly fragile. Getting to our three transformative resultszero unmet need for family planning, zero maternal deaths, and zero gender-based violence and harmful practicescalls for stepping up, not backing down, even in the face of setbacks. Fourth, our ability to be agile and responsive was in no small measure a result of the flexibilities that the early payment of core resources afforded us. Most critically, the pandemic shines a harsh light on what we know to be true: gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls is central to every single other development goal. Strategic Plan Our next Strategic Plan 2022-2025 responds to these lessons and is poised to meet this moment. It will be a global call to action to achieve our three zeros, based on data and evidence. We want to use the next four years to contribute to a planet that is resilient, and that starts with resilient individuals, communities, countries. This means building on our clear comparative advantages as a public health agency within the broader UN development system and maintaining a clear sense of where we can make an impact on a much bigger scale. In March, I travelled to Sudan and saw the power of our collective investment in women and young people as drivers of development and peace. Indeed, the face of the transition in Sudan is female and it is young. A highlight of my mission was handing over the keys to a tuk-tuk ambulance to women leaders in Blue Nile State. Run by women for women and designed to manoeuvre even through rainy season floods, the tuk-tuk will enable free, rapid transport to medical facilities so that women in remote areas can give birth safelycritical for reaching zero maternal deaths. I also met Mama Iqbal, a community leader on Tutti Island, whose tireless efforts led her community to declare zero tolerance for female genital mutilation. She told me: When we hear that a family intends to cut their daughters, we pack our coffee cups and go talk to them. This is what it will take, in community after community, to end the practice everywhere. That is why UNFPA supports women-led organizations  indeed, 40 percent of our humanitarian funding goes to these groups. They understand their communities needs and are the ones providing front-line support to women and girls. With more Mama Iqbals and other allies, including men and boys, I believe that we can get to zero FGM. This demonstrates why long-term investment in social norm change at community level is so important  a key feature of our next Strategic Plan. The Plan will also focus on innovation, building on our experiences, for example, with telemedicine and digital technologies during the pandemic. UNFPA will invest in strengthening our innovation architecture, capabilities and culture, leveraging innovation ecosystems and financing. In Moldova, we have teamed up with leading companies to advocate for gender-responsive family policies that allow couples to meet their desired fertility while supporting womens career aspirations. UNFPA is expanding our partnerships with governments, international financial institutions, the private sector, philanthropies and individual donors to help countries unlock the financing needed to achieve the three zeros. Based on the latest evidence, the plans identified pathways will cover countries in humanitarian and fragile contexts  in line with the QCPR's call for coherence between the humanitarian, development and peace pillars. These pathways will prioritize work with adolescents and youth, the group with the greatest unmet need for contraception. Adolescents and youth are also often on the receiving end of harmful practices. Data is the foundation of all our work. Data and analytics help us to identify those left behind, to inform advocacy and policies, and to support tracking and accountability.  Census is the preeminent source of data for development. Despite postponements due to the pandemic, nearly three-quarters of the population scheduled to be counted in the 2020 census round, was counted. Last year, UNFPA supported the collection of real-time health and demographic data in Somalia; subnational population projections in Honduras and Eswatini; national surveys on violence against women in 10 countries in Asia-Pacific and 23 in East and Southern Africa; analysis of COVID-19 mortality in Latin America and the Caribbean; and a baseline survey on gender stereotypes in Eastern Europe. Making good on our transformative aspirations requires that UNFPA itself transforms. We will emphasize our normative role in all programme countries to advance development policies that address structural inequities and are human rights-based, integrating the effects of megatrends, such as climate change, demographic shifts, inequalities and digitalization. During the next strategic plan phase, UNFPA will expand partnerships with civil society organizations, especially women- and youth-led organizations, and build local capacities to respond to risks and vulnerabilities. We will prioritize the least developed countries and countries in humanitarian contexts. We will step up our work in Small Island Developing States, especially in the Caribbean and the Pacific. We will strengthen our capacity to offer agile and resilient programmes that can reach the last mile, innovating using digital solutions. We will emphasize a tailored response to local contexts, including in middle-income countries. Delivering results together As an agency fully committed to UN reform, UNFPA will continue to work closely with our UN partners for integrated, efficient action at country level. This includes strategic engagement with governments, ministries and parliaments, and aligning the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks and our own country programme documents to respond coherently to national priorities and needs. In keeping with our commitment to deliver as one, last year saw an increase in joint programming, operations and funding, as we worked together to respond to the pandemic. UN pooled funding  at US$226 million  accounted for 27% of total non-core resources in 2020. In Syria, UNFPA and the World Food Programme scaled up an electronic voucher system to help pregnant and breastfeeding women purchase food and hygiene items, and in Zimbabwe, we collaborated on joint distribution of contraceptives and food. Together with the World Health Organization (WHO), we launched innovative online inspections of reproductive health commodities and promoted self-care interventions for sexual and reproductive health. The UNFPA-UNICEF global programme to end child marriage reached over 4.3 million girls with life-skills and sexuality interventions. A joint partnership in East and Southern Africa between UNFPA, WHO, UNAIDS and UNICEF '2gether 4 SRHRhelped governments ensure service continuity and minimize the pandemics impact on vulnerable women, children and young people. The World Bank/UNFPA Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) project helped increase the income of nearly 27,000 girls and prevent 2.4 million unintended pregnancies. UNFPA country offices adapted to continue to deliver for and with young people. In Iran, we supported a mobile health prevention package to reach young women and men at risk of HIV. Digital platforms helped us reach students with disabilities in Mongolia and young people on the autism spectrum in North Macedonia with accurate, age-appropriate sexuality education. In Kenya, UNFPA is working to implement the first-ever development impact bond for adolescent sexual and reproductive health. In Venezuela, UNFPA helped strengthen the health system and increase attention to adolescents through door-to-door distribution of modern contraceptives. With UNFPA support, seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean developed strategies to promote the participation and rights of young people of African descent. We also implemented dedicated initiatives on ageing in more than 10 countries and worked with WHO to operationalize the United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing. Funding These achievements are impressive in the face of a pandemic and were only possible thanks to the strong political and financial support we rely on from our many friendssupport for which we are ever grateful and upon which we depend to keep moving forward. Yet storm clouds are gathering. Coupled with the blow of COVID-19, there are prospects of economic downturn in many countries. Of concern, reductions in official development assistance are bound to hamper collective efforts to create a better future for all. Now, UNFPA Supplies, the flagship of UNFPAs contraceptive commodities provision, faces deep cuts. UNFPA is desperately trying to figure out how to close the financial gap, and we call on this Executive Board for its full support. The drastic loss of funding means the Supplies Partnership will be unable to prevent around a quarter of a million maternal and child deaths, over 14.5 million unintended pregnancies and more than 4 million unsafe abortions. While ODA remains vital, increasing flows of public and private domestic and international finance is essential to bridge the US$222 billion investment gap UNFPA and our partners estimate the entire reproductive health sector will need to achieve the three zeros by 2030. Getting funding to financing right will be critical to deliver on our ambitions. Integrated Budget The integrated budget reflects these elevated ambitions. It is based on prudent income projections, not needs, which as we know are much higher. UNFPA is building its country programmes as investment cases to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We need your support, both political and financial, to achieve the Strategic Plans ambition, and to make its accompanying Integrated Budget a reality. With a more difficult funding landscape as countries emerge from the pandemic, the need for core resources and increased multi-year funding, in keeping with the Secretary-Generals funding compact, cannot be overstated. For our part, UNFPA continues to enhance organizational effectiveness and efficiency, fully achieving all four outputs in this area and realizing operational efficiency gains of US$8.3 million in 2020. We remain committed to investing in our staffUNFPAs greatest assetand equipping them with the skills UNFPA needs to be fit for purpose. Humanitarian activities Madam President, Today, UNFPA is providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance in more than 60 countries. I saw first-hand the critical need for these essential services during my recent humanitarian missions, where I heard harrowing stories of desperation, sexual violence and exploitation. In Yemen, families are marrying off their young daughters. At a locally run UNFPA shelter, I spoke to many girls who were promised a brighter future through marriage, but whose lives only got worse. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, I met Larise. She was raped by five men on her way home from a food distribution site and was so severely beaten that she spent five months in the hospital. The men broke my body and shattered my soul, she told me. I listened as woman after woman recounted similar stories of the horrible, heavy price they pay with their rights, their bodies and their lives. Yet these women are not passive victims. They were emboldened to call for change and for a greater voice in decision-making related to their safety and protection. I shared their demands for action with the network of colleagues devoted to protection from sexual exploitation and abuse. Such feedback mechanisms are essential to protect women's rights and deliver justice. At the global level of humanitarian action, we have a strategy to improve the quality, availability, and delivery of humanitarian supplies; a new approach to gender-based violence; and we are strengthening humanitarian data capacity and human resources, including our surge response. The humanitarian annex to the Annual Report details this progress, including in response to the humanitarian capacity evaluation. Oversight When policies and programmes are informed by credible evaluative evidence there is a powerful multiplier effect on sustainable development. The 2020 Annual Report on the Evaluation function highlights the Offices nimbleness in adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, which generated evidence for an informed recovery and Strategic Plan 2022-2025. The first-ever evaluation of UNFPA support to gender equality and women's empowerment provides evidence and lessons that have been reflected in the new Strategic Plan. With UNFPA co-leading action in the Generation Equality Forum, we know that there is a great deal to be proud of, although clearly there is still work to do. UNFPA continues to invest in all the independent functions. I commend the work of the Ethics Office and the Office of Audit and Investigation Services (OAIS), which is so important to our work and our commitment to accountability, transparency, and zero tolerance for wrongdoing of any kind. UNFPA has prioritized strengthening its independent oversight activities for many years now, with investments growing at ahigher ratethan overall income projections. Mindful of the ever-increasing and evolving complexities of the internal audit and investigation functions, the new Integrated Budget includes US$40.7 million for OAIS for 2022-2025  a 138% increase over the 2010-2013 cycle, including a substantial increased investment in the investigation function. I am very pleased to report that UNFPA obtained an unqualified external audit opinion in 2020 on our 2019 financial statements. We achieved a 96 percent implementation rate for internal audit recommendations, and we continue to invest in fraud prevention, detection and second line of defence controls. We have also introduced mitigation measures in response tothe risks stemming fromthe additional flexibilitiesnecessitatedby thepandemic. Members of the Oversight Advisory Committee, chaired by Ms. Enery Quinones, will soon end their term. UNFPA Senior Leadership have greatly appreciated their highly valuable advice. Speaking of senior management, recently Mr. Benoit Kalasa retired after 25 years of dedicated service to UNFPA, most recently as the Director of the Technical Division. We thank him for his sound technical leadership and valuable contributions to UNFPA. I am pleased to announce that in the coming months Dr. Julitta Onabanjo, currently Regional Director for East and Southern Africa, will take up the reins as Director of the Technical Division in Headquarters. In the interim, Ms. Anneka Knutsson, who leads UNFPAs Sexual and Reproductive Health Branch, will serve as Acting Director. We welcome Mr. Mabingue Ngom as the new Senior Adviser to the Executive Director and Director of the UNFPA Representation Office to the African Union. He will play a pivotal role in strengthening UNFPAs partnerships on the African continent, including with the World Bank and the African Development Bank, building on his leadership in this area, most recently as UNFPA Regional Director for West and Central Africa. Protection from Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment Madam President, UNFPA continues to strengthen our in-house capacities on protection from sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment  a key priority. And we are determined to advance PSEA across the humanitarian sector in our role as Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Champion. Already, UNFPA is building a roster of PSEA experts for rapid deployment to humanitarian and development settings, who will be available as of next month. As Champion, I am spearheading an independent external review of the IASC approach to PSEAH, a training package for practitioners, and an advocacy campaign to inform at-risk individuals about their rights. UNFPA also leads efforts to harmonize the UN-systemwide approach to preventing implementing partner sexual exploitation and abuse. UNFPA will continue to look into every allegation and respond in a prompt, structured and effective manner to every situation, but prevention remains at the centre of our efforts. Ending sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment is a matter of dignity, but its also a matter of power. We will do everything in our power to make sure zero tolerance sticks, for any form of discrimination or abusive behaviour. Madam President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, UNFPA continues to stand up for the sexual and reproductive health and rights of the most vulnerable women and girls, for bodily autonomy, and for peace in the home, whether that home is a house or a tent in a refugee camp. Our most recent State of World Population report  My Body is My Own  highlights why this work is so important. Nearly half of women lack the power to make their own decisions about whether to have sexual relations with their partner, use contraception or seek medical care. And this lack of autonomy can undermine their ability to exercise power and agency in other areas of their lives. Conversely, a woman who has control over her body and lives free from violence is more likely to thrive. And as she thrives, so too will her family, her community and her society. Bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are at the heart of all UNFPA does  essential for full gender equality and a pre-condition for virtually all of the SDGs. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, it was my honour to confer with a key ally in global efforts to protect and defend women, none other than Nobel laureate Dr. Denis Mukwege, whose Panzi Hospital provides survivors of sexual and gender-based violence medical and psychological treatment, job skills and other support. He said: [Women] are the future of this country. It is our responsibility to support them so that they can realize their aspirations, be empowered to defend their rights, and do so in complete freedom. Those who tried to destroy these women didnt succeed because they maintained their strength and kept moving forward. I am confident that, with Member States continued support and partnership and with the creativity and ingenuity UNFPA has in abundance, so too shall we all maintain our strength and keep moving forward. Thank you.   "
NA,"press","03 February 2022","Speech  Statement of the Executive Director to the First Regular Session of the Executive Board 2022 03 February 2022   Greetings! For UNFPA and for me, protection against sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment is a priority expressed in our mandate and by the women and girls we serve. I invite you to watch a brief video highlighting some of the priorities and achievements of my humanitarian championship last year. Based on the independent review UNFPA commissioned, along with other activities, the humanitarian sector now has a better understanding of what is needed to collectively bring a decisive end to sexual exploitation and abuse.   Madam President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, Colleagues and friends,  A very happy and healthy new year to everyone. Congratulations once again, Ambassador Yoka Brandt, on your election as President of the Executive Board, and a warm welcome to the rest of the Bureau: Ambassadors Martin Kimani of Kenya, Jos Manuel Rodrguez Cuadros of Peru, Alya Al-Thani of Qatar, and Sergiy Kyslytsya of Ukraine. We at UNFPA, look forward to working closely with all of you in this pivotal first year of implementation of our new strategic plan.  Our profound thanks go to Ambassador Lachezara Stoeva and the outgoing Bureau for their guidance, support and leadership, which was instrumental in ensuring the endorsement of UNFPAs Strategic Plan and Integrated Budget for 2022-2025. To succeed you need a compass and you need a destination. In this new strategic plan, we have both. It is an ambitious, inspirational roadmap that brings important changes to UNFPAs effort to reach millions of the world's most vulnerable people. We have unity of purpose, unity of vision, and we are united in action. In unity, there is strength. As the Swahili saying goes, Umoja ni nguvu. Now the hard work begins of turning the plans ambition into reality in the lives of women, girls and young people around the world. Accelerate. Transform. Reach whoever is furthest behind.  Our strategic plan is a call to accelerate, not to retreat. As we step up our efforts, transform our programmes, and motivate new partners, we will prioritize the needs of people left furthest behind. What is the secret to UNFPAs conviction that we will succeed? Its our people, our creativity, our partnerships.  That is how, despite challenges, we continue to deliver for women like Firoza, a young Afghan mother of five in Herat Province. Firoza came to a UNFPA-supported Family Health House in severe pain from obstructed labour. The midwife discovered that she was pregnant with twins. Transferring her to another facility was out of the question. The security situation was deteriorating, and her condition was precarious. Fortunately, the skilled doctors and nurse-midwives of UNFPAs 24-hour Midwifery Helpline in Afghanistan were there to guide Firozas local midwife through her difficult birth and then, a life-threatening postpartum haemorrhage. I am very happy to inform you that mother and twins all survived in good health. The new strategic plan contributes directly to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. How should you judge the plans success? It offers pathways for tackling harmful gender norms and deep-seated inequalities, investing in young people, and protecting the bodily autonomy of women and girls, as is their bodyright. It prioritizes prevention and preparedness as well as our work in humanitarian settings. The framework will enhance our engagement with United Nations partners and leverage the United Nations Development System reforms to support the achievement of the ICPD agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. It is wholly reflective of the intent and spirit of the Secretary-Generals Our Common Agenda, to eliminate inequalities, which UNFPA is eager to co-lead. Even in an era of great stressors  a pandemic, economic woes, political turmoil, climate-related disasters  UNFPA intends to move forward. We will stay and deliver, strengthen our performance, and expand collaboration with partners, such as business, academia, women- and youth-led organizations and international financial institutions (IFIs). In developing our strategic plan, we heard from programme country governments and civil society that their expectation is tailored assistance. The strategy responds accordingly. This is reflected in the thirteen Country Programme Documents the Board will consider today. In response to declared national priorities, all the CPDs will be operationalized in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. UNFPA assures collaboration with our United Nations and other partners to ensure coherent, coordinated and efficient delivery of results. Baselines and targets for the integrated results and resources framework will be presented to the annual session of the Board in June. These are critical metrics, and we look forward to briefing the Board as this work progresses.  UNFPA places emphasis on our normative role. We deliver on what women and girls say they want and desperately need in their communities, where it counts: access to family planning services, reproductive health care and protection from all forms of violence and abuse.  I am proud to report that UNFPA remains a field-focused organization. Eighty-eight percent of the Funds budget is allocated to the field and 84 percent is expended on programme. With our commitment to good stewardship of the financial resources entrusted to us, I am pleased that the Board of Auditors certified UNFPA with a clean bill of health  an unqualified audit for the financial year ended 31 December 2020. We achieved a high implementation rate of recommendations over the past two years, and we are further strengthening proactive oversight and monitoring activities as we implement remaining recommendations. High-quality evaluations provide UNFPA with important lessons for more effective programming. We look forward to the Evaluation Offices presentation of the four-year evaluation plan this afternoon.  The budget that was approved in September includes ongoing investments in the Office of Audit and Investigation Services and the Evaluation and Ethics Offices, reflecting UNFPA commitment and welcoming of oversight and accountability.   Madam President, Distinguished Delegates,  The transformative results UNFPA seeks to achieve require looking within and asking ourselves: do we have the structure, systems, processes and organizational culture we need? What changes do we need to make so that we are able to react, adapt and innovate to deliver on the Strategic Plan?  One example is our Enterprise Resource Planning project, which will ensure UNFPA has an up-to-date and flexible information technology infrastructure. Now as we enter the final stretch of this work, the aim is to begin operating on the new system later this year. This project is a complex one, and like many IT endeavours, it has not been without its challenges and unforeseen delays. At this time, however, we are confident that the end product will deliver a solid working system, together with a strong capacity-development component. We will assure that the Board is kept abreast of this important work as we attain relevant milestones.  Another example is the new UNFPA Supply Chain Management Unit to consolidate our leadership role as the largest multilateral provider of contraceptives and in ensuring reproductive health commodity security. We expect the new arrangement will result in better preparedness, increased efficiency and reduced costs.  Yet another innovation is the new Reproductive Health Bridging Fund  a short-term, interest-free financing product. It is available to qualified governments interested in allocating domestic resources to procure reproductive health commodities through UNFPA, when advance payment is not possible.  The Reproductive Health Bridging Fund will create a sustainable pathway for countries to become self-sufficient in meeting their sexual and reproductive health procurement needs. We invite and look forward to donor support to kickstart this initiative. Was 2021 a challenging year? Yes, it was. Precisely because of that, UNFPA hit the road. We communicated our results. We demonstrated our deep resolve to accelerate, to step up our efforts to provide the additional support women and girls will need to get through this pandemic. Covid-19 has brought to the fore many hidden crises, especially the global surge in domestic violence, and striking increases in marriage of underage girls, female genital mutilation and adolescent pregnancy. In Mexico, the Government estimates that unintended pregnancies in adolescents increased by fully 30 percent last year. In Kenya, girls out of school for 6 months due to the pandemic were twice as likely to become pregnant. Once conditions allowed, I personally visited 15 countries last year. Many are facing complex humanitarian situations, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Sudan and Yemen. I assure you that I saw the difference additional resources can make on the ground. Resources are key to UNFPA success. While we are still awaiting a final count of contributions, total funding in 2021 rose to over US$1.4 billion  a record high. Co-financing contributions totaled US$994 million dollars, and we expect core funding at near-record levels. Thank you! Pledges by donor governments increased by 10% last year, and programme country contributions went up more than 130%. UNFPA also mobilized nearly US$56 million in partnership with the World Bank and other IFIs, and private sector funding was up as well. In response to the dire conditions that conflict, climate-induced disasters and a pandemic have created in our world, UNFPA humanitarian funding also came in at an all-time high  US$332 million, representing about one-third of total co-financing resources.  Total contributions to UNFPA Supplies for 2021 reached US$165 million, ensuring that progress continued. The UNFPA Supplies Partnership aims to end the unmet for family planning in more than 50 partner countries by 2030.  UNFPA was extremely fortunate that a strong alliance of dedicated donors stepped in to help cover the extreme cut to the Partnership early last year.   Through the Supplies Partnership, UNFPA support helped reach marginalized and underserved women and girls, strengthen sustainable domestic financing of family planning programmes, and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on supply chains. New family planning methods were introduced in several countries to expand the choice and range of supplies available. While the additional funding support in 2021 came at a critical time, sustained longer-term funding for UNFPA Supplies is not a given. I appeal for the desperately needed support required for partner countries to address the reproductive health needs of their growing youth populations.  Such support can transform the life of a young women. In Zambia, UNFPA met Cristabel after she became pregnant at age 16. Our programmes helped her return to school while caring for her infant. Today, she uses a long-acting contraceptive method provided by the UNFPA Supplies programme. Cristabel no longer worries about another unintended pregnancy derailing her dream of completing her education.  I thank Member States for your generous contributions, which UNFPA uses to save and improve lives. Your help sends a message of hope to women, girls and young people, like Firoza and Cristabel, that they are not alone in their time of need; that their rights and choices matter.  Core funding, in particular, anchors our work and offers UNFPA flexibility to mount an agile response to unforeseen challenges like the Covid-19 pandemic.  Already, two years of pandemic threaten two decades of progress for women and girls, thus making the path to 2030 a lot steeper. As a global community, to get back on track in this decade of action, will now require deeper, smarter, more sustainable investments  in health; in education; in innovation and digital solutions; and in infrastructure. These are interconnected investments that would save millions of lives and that we know yield economic benefits many times their cost. Investments that must occur now  if we are to recover from Covid, transform the rhetoric of resilience into reality, and keep moving forward. The UNFPA Strategic Plan aims to shift development funding into a financing model. By leveraging relatively modest amounts of UNFPA core resources catalytically, our new Strategic Investment Facility will bring projects to scale by mobilizing far greater sums from domestic government resources, concessional loans by IFIs, in-country donor contributions, and investments from the private sector. For example, through the Strategic Investment Facility we could more easily create and manage development impact bonds, something we are currently exploring in Kenya. Such blended financing innovations could accelerate improvements in the reproductive health and rights situation of women and girls.  Madam President, Distinguished Delegates, No discussion of resources would be complete without mentioning UNFPAs greatest asset  our committed and dedicated personnel. To deliver on the ambition of the new strategic plan, we need to make sure that our staff are supported with the knowledge, skills and resources to succeed. Through enhanced orientation programmes, leadership training, professional development, and succession planning, UNFPAs new People Strategy will help us recruit, nurture and retain a talented workforce. Our staff will be ready and able to contribute fully, with collective hard work and an innovative mindset: To reverse the trend that we are now seeing for the hundreds of millions of women and girls whose need for family planning increasingly goes unmet, resulting in untold unintended pregnancies. To save the lives of the over 800 women and girls who die every day in pregnancy and childbirth from largely preventable causes; and To protect the 1 in 3 women around the world who experience sexual and gender-based violence, the 1 in 5 girls forced into early marriage, and in communities where female genital mutilation is prevalent to defend the 1 in 3 girls who might suffer that harmful practice. Our efforts and our energy are focused on achieving zero unmet need for contraception, zero preventable maternal deaths and a definitive end to all forms of gender-based violence. This work, indeed everything we do, is based upon population data and evidence. Governments, researchers and service providers need access to quality data so that they know where to direct programmes, policies and resources. I am happy to report that, after some Covid-related disruptions to the 2020 census round, we have the largest number of countries ever planning censuses  56 countries in 2022 and 20 in 2023. In the past two years, even with a pandemic raging, UNFPA staff across the globe found innovative ways to deliver better, and they have achieved impressive, tangible results. Now, the question is: how do we build on this can-do spirit? Covid-19 is challenging us. Yet it has also been instructive. The lessons learned will help us rise to new challenges as we promote sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights and aim to reach those furthest behind. Leaving no one behind will mean making the vulnerable visible. Therefore, UNFPAs Geospatial Dashboard on Intimate Partner Violence, for example, provides access to disaggregated data at the local level to help policymakers better understand and pinpoint solutions. Reaching those furthest behind will require complementarity across the humanitarian-development-peace continuum  in other words, the nexus. With the world now facing its highest number of conflicts since 1945; with violence, political instability, displacement and climate-related disasters taking a massive toll and exacerbating humanitarian needs; with erosion of international law threatening human rights; and rising populism, racism and extremism adding fuel to the fire, global solidarity is needed now more than ever. And let us never forget that all these crises hit women and girls disproportionately hard. Poverty rates for women and girls continue to rise, and worsening food insecurity is devastating for millions of people already struggling to survive, with a catastrophic impact on the nutrition and health of women, adolescents, and newborns. Let us remember that women dont stop giving birth in times of crisis. Nearly 60 percent of preventable maternal deaths occur in countries with humanitarian and fragile contexts. An estimated 1 in 5 forcibly displaced women in humanitarian crises has been subjected to sexual and gender-based violence. And girls in these settings are 90 percent more likely to be out of school and vulnerable to harm. The new UNFPA strategic plan for the first time has a specific outcome on humanitarian action. Our humanitarian interventions are mission critical, and we therefore are strengthening our preparedness and response capacity and systems. This work is showing results and it is saving lives. Last year alone, more than 29 million women of reproductive age received sexual and reproductive health services, such as contraceptives, supplies for safe deliveries and personal protective equipment.  More than 2 million survivors of gender-based violence accessed services through 12,000 safe spaces. Innovative ways of working during the pandemic helped us reach over 75 million people, both in person and remotely, with vital information about sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence.  This Executive Board can be proud of this success. Yet the SRHR needs are so much greater.  In response, UNFPA is in the midst of our largest humanitarian appeal to date. We are calling for US$835 million to provide life-saving sexual and reproductive health and protection services to more than 54 million women, girls, and young people in 61 countries this year. UNFPA is committed to fulfilling our leadership role in the Gender-based Violence Area of Responsibility and to ensuring, with our partners, that every woman and girl may enjoy peace in the home, even if that home is a tent in a refugee camp.  Madam President, UNFPA engages with and invests in women-led organizations to address the acute needs of women and girls. In the past two years, notably, UNFPA allocated 38% of our humanitarian funds to women-led community-based organizations, and we commit to increasing this figure to 43% by the year 2025. We ask for Member States support and stronger shared accountability for delivering the full protection and dignified humanitarian assistance that women and girls need.  Madam President, Distinguished Delegates, With this Strategic Plan 2022-2025, UNFPA takes a giant stride forward. Data and evidence, digitalization and innovation, and strategies aimed at inclusion  of women and women-led organizations, of persons with disabilities, of adolescents and youth, of LGBTIQ+ individuals, people of African descent and indigenous peoples, etc.  will ensure that we reach our destination and that no one is left behind. Leaving no one behind will mean removing all barriers to fundamental rights. As part of our leadership of the Generation Equality action coalition, I challenged our leadership and our communication colleagues to redefine bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive health and rights  not as jargon but as the game-changer it becomes when a girl understands her human rights and the respect that is indeed her birthright. The results were a historic State of World Population report, My Body is My Own, and a viral campaign that is reaching millions with the bodyright message.  In some places, rising concern about low fertility and population ageing is putting pressure on womens reproductive rights. In other places, a youthful population is opening the window of opportunity towards a demographic dividend. UNFPA is equipped to help countries on both ends of the spectrum to find opportunity in demographic change. The Decade of Demographic Resilience, launched in Bulgaria in December last year, is an example of countries galvanizing joint action to understand and fully harness these opportunities to thrive.  UNFPA partners with innovators around the world to accelerate progress and advance sexual and reproductive health and rights. For example, the Burkina Faso Country Office adapted our digital toolkit, YouthConnect, to create a civil registration tool that enables midwives to register births in real time via mobile phone. Other adaptations include an app in Nepal that delivers health messages to pregnant women; a case management platform for community healthcare workers in Nicaragua; and an app supporting the learning needs of adolescents with autism in North Macedonia. Leaving no one behind means protecting the most vulnerable from harm. Mobile platforms developed with UNFPA support are linking FGM survivors and at-risk girls in Uganda with the urgent services they need and survivors of gender-based violence in Armenia, Georgia and Iraq with a supportive online community. Leaving no one behind means leaving no room for discrimination or exclusion. In Latin America and the Caribbean, UNFPAs Youth Leadership School for young people of African descent equips them to understand and exercise their rights and strengthen their technical and entrepreneurial skills so that they and their communities can thrive. UNFPA also wants to ensure that persons with disabilities are meaningfully engaged in all we do. Our new Disability Inclusion Strategy will guide us in becoming an organization that welcomes human diversity and ensures equality and non-discrimination of persons with disabilities, in line with the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy.  Madam President, Distinguished Delegates,  I thank the Board for the confidence you have placed in me, and I look forward to your continued guidance, support and partnership as we forge ahead together over the next four years towards those three transformative zeros.  Allow me now to turn the floor over to Mr. Bjorn Anderson, UNFPA Regional Director for the Asia Pacific, based in Thailand, who will provide a brief update on some of UNFPAs humanitarian activities in that region.  [brief statement by Bjorn Anderson]  Thank you, Bjorn, for the presentation and more importantly for the work your team is spearheading.  Madam President, Distinguished Delegates,  At UNFPA, we are committed to bring more regional voices into our Executive Board sessions to demonstrate how the Boards support and guidance helps UNFPA make a difference on the ground. UNFPA is there to accelerate progress and transform the lives of the women, girls and young people we serve. Again, my thanks to you, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, for your strong engagement. I look forward to our discussion today."
NA,"press","08 June 2023","Statement  Statement of the Executive Director to the Annual Session of the Executive Board 2023 08 June 2023   Check against delivery Good morning. Buenos dias. We have prepared a brief video that illustrates in just a few frames the life-and-death circumstances in which far too many women and adolescent girls around the world find themselves. Let us view it now. I hope this helps us see why midwives are so essential. Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, Colleagues and friends, What a pleasure to be here with you for this Annual Session of the Executive Board. We welcome Ambassador nal of Trkiye to his first formal session as Vice-President. In this world of conflict and crisis, somewhere, a woman in labour is hiding in a makeshift shelter to avoid rocket fire. Will she and her baby survive? Will the midwife make it to her in time? Unfortunately, too often the answer is no. UNFPA and our United Nations partners latest maternal mortality estimates confirm this. Indeed, decades of progress in preventing maternal deaths  after Covid, because of conflict, with encroaching climate disasters  have ground to a screeching halt. In the year 2020, an estimated 287,000 women died during pregnancy, childbirth or the aftermath, according to our new data: thats one woman dying every two minutes. Yet, I chose an opening video that tells a story of resilience, of tenacity and of courage amidst challenge. We need such stories of hope. Countless midwives across the globe demonstrate these traits each and every day. They accompany women as new life is brought into the world. Midwives support mothers and their newborns when they are most vulnerable. They are often the only healthcare workers serving in hard-to-reach places. Midwives are vital partners in UNFPAs push to reach the last mile and leave no woman or girl behind. Training and support to midwives is at the heart of UNFPAs Maternal Health Thematic Fund. That story of hope and persistence is the story of UNFPA, standing with midwives and the women, girls and communities they serve. In just a few days, I will join thousands of proud midwives in Bali, Indonesia, as I participate in the opening of the International Confederation of Midwives Triennial Congress. I gladly journey there to express UNFPAs solidarity and commitment to expanding the worlds midwifery workforce. Midwives form the backbone of community-based sexual and reproductive health care. This is one of the most cost-effective ways to end preventable maternal deaths. Thats why we work with partners to address the global shortage of almost a million midwives. If UNFPA succeeds, midwives could help prevent two thirds of maternal and newborn deaths. This is one investment the world cannot afford to miss. Bear in mind, unintended pregnancy is another critical factor in deaths during pregnancy, if the mother is too young, if she experiences complications or if she resorts to unsafe abortion. UNFPA research shows that nearly half of all pregnancies are unintended and that unsafe abortion is a leading cause of maternal death. Let us never forget that many of those who die in childbirth are not women at all  they are girls, some as young as 10 to 14 years old. Half a million births each year take place among girls so young they might not even realize they can get pregnant. Girls too young to consent to sex; girls married off or abused, or both. Ignorance is not innocence  too often, it becomes a death sentence. One that could have been prevented with timely access to quality sexual and reproductive health information and services. The effort required to tackle maternal deaths is no mystery. Health sector workers and policymakers know what to do: increase access to a range of quality contraceptives of the womans choice, improve comprehensive sexuality education for young people to avoid early pregnancy, and protect a womans right to decide whether, when, how often and with whom to have children. Rights and choices. We know this saves and transforms lives. Yet sexual and reproductive health and rights somehow continually face intense political pushback. Fortunately, there is also tremendous commitment to keep pushing forward together  on comprehensive sexuality education and on the full range of rights and choices. We urge Member States and all other partners to seize opportunities for dialogue; to seek consensus, through the ICPD30 process and other intergovernmental arenas, including the High-Level Political Forum, the upcoming SDG Summit, next years Commission on Population and Development, and the Summit of the Future. With the stakes so high, womens rights and choices are something we should all agree on. A commitment to accelerate progress and keep pushing forward, whatever the challenges, is at the heart of our strategic plan adopted by this Executive Board. It is reflected in our commitment to work within and beyond the United Nations to step up progress, and it is essential if we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and fulfil the ICPD Programme of Action. I am proud of the results we achieved with your support and guidance in 2022, as outlined in my annual report. Last year, UNFPA helped avert more than 13.3 million unintended pregnancies and 3.7 million unsafe abortions. We assisted 1.4 million safe deliveries in 39 humanitarian-affected countries and trained around 80,000 midwives globally. More than 111,000 girls were saved from female genital mutilation and over 15,000 women and girls received treatment for obstetric fistula. The UNFPA Supplies Partnership continues to show excellent results and is such a tremendous investment. In 2022, contraceptives provided through the UNFPA Supplies programme, worth approximatelyUS$123 million, saved countries and families an estimated US$508 million in reduced care for pregnancy, delivery and post-abortion care. Beyond these global figures are the results at country level. In Cabo Verde, 75 per cent of health and education professionals and police were trained in gender-based violence prevention and response. In Bolivia, the teenage pregnancy rate fell by half between 2018 and 2022. In UNFPA-supported districts in Bangladesh, contraceptive stock-outs were virtually eliminated. In China, the number of women screened for cervical cancer doubled in one hospital, due to improved service provider capacity and proactive health promotion. The list goes on. Yet, I would be remiss in not stressing that in far too many places sustainable development is endangered, rights appear to be in retreat, and peace in peril. The impacts of COVID, conflict, climate change, economic and geopolitical setbacks, and proliferating humanitarian crises have made our path to 2030 steeper. At UNFPA, we know our goals. In the over 130 countries where we work, we remain focused on our normative work and targeting those subjected to multiple, intersecting forms of discrimination, including people of African descent, indigenous populations, people with disabilities, refugees and people on the move. Last week, I was pleased to address the second session of the Permanent Forum on People of African Descent here in New York and to renew UNFPAs commitment to advancing the Afro-descendant agenda. I take this opportunity to assert that UNFPA will continue to proudly uphold the human rights of LGBTQI+ and gender-diverse people. We recently welcomed our latest staff-led group, Pride@UNFPA. They join the youthful Tangerines, Women@UNFPA and our efforts in policy and action to strengthen disability inclusion  all reflective of our push to create a workplace culture of openness, trust and mutual respect. We are scaling up innovations, such as the use of telemedicine and digital platforms for services, and we are investing in women innovators to address challenges in maternal health, family planning, menstruation and gender-based violence. UNFPA is leading the way in bringing the issue of technology-facilitated gender-based violence into the spotlight, including in Silicon Valley. In Argentina, we integrated technology-facilitated GBV into the comprehensive sexuality education curriculum to ensure that young people are digitally literate, can protect themselves online and claim their #bodyright. Through our Equity 2030 Alliance, we work with a broad range of partners to close the gender gap in science, technology and finance so that the needs of women and girls are integrated into the design of health solutions right from the beginning. For too long, men  in particular, adult white men  have been the default reference population in research and studies, ultimately resulting in a worse standard of care for women. In all of this work, we endeavour to hold ourselves to the highest standards of transparency, accountability and oversight, and we know that the tone at the top is critical. We continue to reinforce measures for protection from sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment, prioritizing the rights and dignity of victims and survivors, and ensuring that offenders are held accountable. Its why we have made important investments in our oversight offices. This includes supporting the strengthening of the independence of the Office of Audit and Investigation Services (OAIS) by providing adequate resources within the approved budget. And I am pleased to report that management and OAIS have agreed on final revisions to the OAIS Charter, which will be implemented shortly. UNFPA entities, including our independent functions, have created a UNFPA integrity group. It brings together different offices to enhance accountability and transparency. We are instituting new tools, training and guidance to support the effective implementation of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) policy. We are enhancing how we ensure compliance with recommendations from independent oversight bodies. All of this is with a view to strengthening our speak-up culture and ensuring we remain effective and efficient custodians of public resources that deliver lifesaving results for women and girls. I am therefore pleased to report that UNFPA achieved a 91% implementation rate for internal audit recommendations due by year-end 2022. Furthermore, no recommendations older than 18 months are outstanding. I aim to assure that UNFPA will maintain this strong implementation rate this year and beyond. We know that UNFPA needs to remain adaptive and open, as always, to improvement. In this regard, we welcome the Joint Inspection Unit review of management and administration in UNFPA. There will be a separate presentation of the report and management response later today. As you know, Quantum, the new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, went live in January 2023. I am happy to report that, after a brief period of increased support, the system is now stable and operating as planned. Our focus now will be on the remaining modules and continued improvements to ensure that we will benefit from the system for years to come. In particular, this year the UNFPA module for more streamlined results planning and monitoring will be updated. The Quantum ERP was the principal component of our ICT transformation project, approved by the Board, which has a total planned cost of US$39 million, of which US$31 million was expended by the end of 2022. Full separate disclosure of the project is included in our statutory Financial Statements currently being audited by the United Nations Board of Auditors. Evaluation continues to provide important insight into our activities on the ground  what works, what we need to do better and how. UNFPA welcomes the 2022 Annual Report on evaluation. We commend the use of innovative evaluative approaches, including the launch of a feasibility study to leverage Artificial Intelligence. And we look forward to the outcomes and recommendations of the ongoing peer review of the evaluation function. We also welcome the two recent centralized evaluations before the Board. The formative evaluation of UNFPA support to population dynamics and data is the first on this theme in the organization, and it includes a specific focus on the demographic dividend and population ageing and low fertility. The formative evaluation of UNFPA support to adolescents and youth acknowledges the holistic approach of our adolescents and youth strategy  My Body, My Life, My World  and will help us enhance this work. Of particular note, a Youth Steering Committee worked alongside the senior evaluation team  an intergenerational partnership to increase the voice and agency of youth evaluators, as advisors, decision makers, and key contributors of evidence and insight. The evaluations recognize UNFPAs forward-looking thought leadership on important global agendas and will help inform the midterm review of our Strategic Plan. Mr. President, In the lead-up to ICPD30 next year, UNFPA is linking wherever we can  with the rest of the UN, governments, the private sector, women-led groups, youth groups, religious groups, parliamentarians and civil society. We encourage Member States to support national, regional and global initiatives related to the ICPD Review  including national consultations, regional population conferences and the three global dialogues  on youth, demographic diversity and the impact of technology on the ICPD agenda. The ICPD base is expanding with new alliances and vocal partners. The ICPD30 review provides an opportunity to reflect on past achievements, take stock of challenges, reduce polarization and misinformation and chart a course for the future. UNFPA continues to build a case for rights and choices, and we rely on data and evidence to guide this work and everything we do. Our recent State of World Population report, titled 8 Billion Lives, Infinite Possibilities  The case for rights and choices, shows that world population is radically shifting. At 8 billion, our human family is now larger than ever before, and the world more demographically diverse. Two-thirds of people live in a place with below-replacement fertility. Others live in countries experiencing vigorous population growth. Everyone wants to know what all of this means, and without a clear answer, there is a serious risk that human rights, and particularly reproductive rights, could be undermined. We must not allow womens bodies to be held captive to population targets. Mr. President, Turning now to UNFPA humanitarian action  more important than ever in a world beset by conflict, crisis and rising humanitarian need, I am reminded of these lines by the Somali-British poet Warsan Shire from her poem What they did yesterday afternoon. later that night i held an atlas in my lap ran my fingers across the whole world and whispered where does it hurt? it answered everywhere everywhere everywhere. This time last year, 274 million people needed humanitarian assistance -- a 17% rise from the previous year. For 2023, that number has grown yet again, to 339 million people in need. This is a very alarming trend that affects women and girls disproportionately. They are already the hardest hit by poverty and hunger and are the most vulnerable to sexual and gender-based violence, especially during conflicts. To reach our three zeros  zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices, we must continue to deliver, and deliver well, in humanitarian settings. In April, the humanitarian Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) declared a system-wide scale-up for Haiti, where much of the capital of Port-au-Prince is under control of armed gangs, and over 40% of the population need humanitarian assistance and protection. UNFPA is one of very few agencies still able to operate in Haitis gang territories, because we apply a community-based approach, which builds the acceptance that protects us. With gender-based violence response identified as a top priority, UNFPA is focusing on scale-up of lifesaving sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence services. In Sudan, hopes for peace and stability hang by a thread as the country slips towards humanitarian catastrophe. More than a million people have been displaced, exposing women and girls to increased risk of gender-based violence. Sudan already had one of the worlds highest maternal mortality rates before the fighting broke out. Now, over 90,000 women are expected to give birth during the next three months. A BBC report earlier this week showed just how dire the situation is in the few maternity wards that remain open: health providers working around the clock, often without anaesthesia and other resources. Caesarean sections being performed with only a few mobile phones to illuminate the area of operation. In Sudan, UNFPA works with a network of over 400 local midwives to provide safe deliveries. Weve distributed 10 metric tons of lifesaving supplies, and we are providing fuel to maternity hospitals in Khartoum so that services remain available during frequent electricity black-outs. Let me emphasize that health facilities should never be a target. Health workers should never be a target. UNFPA stands in solidarity with our partners and with health workers in insisting that humanitarian law must be respected. In Afghanistan, the erosion of womens rights, including the recent ban on women working with the United Nations, is deeply disturbing, complicating the delivery of lifesaving assistance. Yet, UNFPA continues to deliver. Last month in Geneva, UNFPA joined IASC Principals in assessing the operational challenges and the collective action required to strengthen operations in Sudan, Syria, Haiti, Burkina Faso, Afghanistan, and Myanmar. We committed to strengthening collective advocacy, localization, preparedness, and protection, and to address the big funding gaps. In Ukraine and elsewhere, UNFPA and our humanitarian partners are on the frontlines, delivering a response that is relevant to the needs identified by the affected communities themselves. Yet, what they need above all is peace. We know that in many cases, were it not for UNFPA, no one would be there to raise the alarm about the dire plight of women and girls, nor to look after their sexual and reproductive health and rights. With needs far outstripping the resources available, we also know that we need to think and work differently  to focus on prevention and build resilience, so that humanitarian interventions lay the groundwork for development. We also know we need to partner like never before. We are very grateful for the increase in humanitarian funding, even as we remain concerned about the funding outlook for 2023 and beyond. I appeal to Member States for your continued support, especially for core resources but also more flexible other resources. We have closed the books for 2022, and we note with appreciation that UNFPA mobilized a total ofUS$1.55 billion in overall resources, well above the Strategic Plan revenue target, includingUS$442.5 million in core funding. Cofinancing reached US$1.1 billion, with an increased share of 42% received for our humanitarian work. We urge Member States to prioritize long-term, predictable funding and financing for sexual and reproductive health and rights, including both targeted official development assistance and increased domestic resources. Data and evidence consistently show that these are investments with huge returns  for the individual, for economies and for societies. UNFPA is working to use our own funding and expertise to leverage significant, broader financing across a range of actors and financing instruments  domestic, and international, public, and private. I just returned from Kazakhstan, where UNFPA, in partnership with the Government and with funding from the World Bank, supported the development of a regulatory framework to ensure the sustainability of a network of youth-friendly health centres. A key result of the project was the Governments decision to lower the age of consent to receive outpatient services to 16 years of age. In Almaty, I met with a group of young people at one centre who spoke enthusiastically about the difference the services, information and support provided make in their lives. The Government has now expanded the programme across the entire country with a sustainable budget of around 12 million USD per year. Another quick example of funding-to-financing innovation is a new agreement of nearly US$10 million with the Government of Angola for UNFPA to support a World Bank project to improve access to health services and information for adolescents and youth, through partnerships with civil society organizations. I share these examples to assure the Executive Board that UNFPA is working hard to address financing gaps. However, as important as these initiatives are, they cannot replace core resources. Core resources are irreplaceable. Mr. President, At the end of June, we say goodbye to two esteemed, long-standing UNFPA leaders: Ms.Argentina Matavel Piccin, Regional Director for West and Central Africa, and Mr. Mabingue Ngom, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director and Director of UNFPA Representation Office to the African Union, and previously, Regional Director for West and Central Africa and Director of the UNFPA Programme Division. I want thank Argentina and Mabingue. Your dedication to advancing the ICPD mandate throughout your distinguished careers has made a difference to millions of women and girls around the world. I also welcome Mr. Sennen Hounton as the new Regional Director for West and Central Africa, bringing extensive programmatic and technical experience to the role. We look forward to Sennens contributions. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to bring voices from the field to you in New York, with your permission, I am now pleased to turn the floor over to Ms. Lydia Zigomo, Regional Director for East and Southern Africa, to update you on UNFPA activities there. Thank you, Lydia, for your leadership and for the important work the ESARO team is doing.Id also like to acknowledge the hard work of my leadership team  our deputies and directors and representatives around the world  and indeed of our staff. These are dedicated individuals who every single day live up to the expectations of our mandate. I am very grateful to them all. Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, In the nearly thirty years since the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development, with its groundbreaking Programme of Action, together we have made significant progress in advancing reproductive health and rights. Yet, we are still far from the finish line. The 10-year-old girls of the world are still waiting. They are waiting for us to put aside our differences, find common ground, exercise joint leadership and help them. They want to finish their education, stay healthy, avoid the calamity of unintended pregnancy, and they want us to help them reach their infinite potential. That 10-year-old girl is real. She and millions just like her keep UNFPA committed and focused. We focus on her rights, her choices, her bright future of unlimited horizons. Thank you. "
NA,"press","07 September 2017","    Speech  Statement of Acting Executive Director to Second Regular Session of Executive Board 2017 07 September 2017   Before I begin my formal remarks, I would like to express, on behalf of all of us in UNFPA, our sympathies to all those affected by Hurricane Irma. Our thoughts are with the countries and people of the Caribbean and all those caught in Irmas path. Please know that UNFPA is committed to ensuring that our support to the Caribbean reflects the special circumstances of the region and its vulnerability to natural disasters. UNFPA stands with you in this time of need, and you can count on our support.  Mr. President,Distinguished Delegates,Colleagues and friends,Ladies and gentlemen, Good morning! It is a pleasure to be here with you all for this Second Regular Session of the Executive Board. Today, you have before you the UNFPA roadmap for bringing transformative change to the women, adolescent girls and young people we serve  the UNFPA Strategic Plan and Integrated Budget for the period 2018-2021. On behalf of all of us at UNFPA, let me thank you, the Members of the Executive Board, once again for your active engagement and guidance over the past year as we developed and refined these documents. As you know, the new Strategic Plan was developed in a highly consultative and transparent process and reflects not only the feedback and input of Member States, but also the broadest possible cross-section of UNFPA partners, as well as UNFPA staff from all levels of the organization. We are very proud that it is a homegrown plan. The first of three strategic plans paving the way to 2030, it also reflects and fully embraces the bold vision set forth in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is a bold vision that is going to require bold action, greater and more effective collaboration, and out-of-the-box thinking about how the UN system and its partners can deliver more effectively together. The common chapter contained in our Strategic Plan, which is shared with UN-WOMEN, UNICEF and UNDP, is a step forward in this vision. Meeting the ambitious pledge to leave no one behind calls for greater coherence, integration, inclusive partnerships, and innovation. It calls for a UN system capable of responding holistically and effectively to the needs of people and governments, building on in-country capacity and leveraging partnerships for greater impact on the lives of the poorest and the most excluded. This also means mobilizing greater resources, marshaling greater political support, and broadening partnerships  and the agility and flexibility to do so in a complex, challenging and constantly changing environment. UNFPA is committed to rising to this challenge  indeed, we are already doing so. Because it is clear that if we want to protect the gains we have made to date and advance real change  and we do  business as usual will not do. Our new Strategic Plan builds on UNFPA strengths and comparative advantage in sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, gender equality and women's empowerment, adolescents and youth, and population data for development. Our focus will be on leaving no one behind and reaching the furthest behind first through consolidation of gains, innovation to deepen and broaden our reach, and through strategic partnerships, which we depend on to achieve collective outcomes for humanity. The plan introduces a series of changes that consolidate our efforts and will strengthen the coherence, effectiveness and efficiency of UNFPAs work; and the roll-out and implementation will take place as part of a broader change process within the organization. We have three transformative, people-centred results  zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths and zero harmful practices and gender-based violence  to ensure that we have a rallying cry for advocacy, communication, partnerships and resource mobilization. As the custodian of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action, and in the face of increasing pushback on sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and womens rights more broadly, UNFPA must continue to support and promote the progress achieved together over the past two decades through this rights-based approach. This forward momentum is ensuring that more and more women have access to voluntary family planning and are able to decide whether or when to have children, that more and more women and newborns survive childbirth and thrive, that more girls are able to go to and stay in school and to live free from harmful practices, that more and more of the worlds 1.8 billion adolescents and young people have access to sexual and reproductive health services and information. We have made enormous progress, with the support and guidance of the Board, and at the urging of our programme countries, and we will not go back. The reaffirmed Bulls Eye at the centre of our Strategic Plan lays out the overarching goal to achieve universal access to sexual and reproductive health, to realize reproductive rights, to reduce maternal mortality, and to accelerate progress on the ICPD agenda. This includes a focus on strengthening health systems, together with Member States and other UN and development partners, including our H6 partnership, with an emphasis on quality of care, equity in access, and social protection. The Strategic Plan also focuses on supporting country efforts to strengthen data collection, analysis and use, and to identify and track inequalities through censuses  to ensure targeted investments, and achieve national development goals. Addressing poverty and inequality is the red thread running through all of these efforts. With eyes on the 2030 horizon, and a focus on systems, on solutions, on innovation and on impact, this Strategic Plan represents the next step towards a new era for UNFPA and for women and young people around the world. As we work to reach adolescent girls and women with sexual and reproductive health services, we are innovating to ensure no one is left behind. We are collaborating to compound our collective impact. And we are advocating to give voice to the voiceless. Indeed, our online photo feature 16 girls, 16 stories of resistance, about a group of courageous girls in Niger standing up against child marriage, was recognized with a prestigious Webby Award, and the Webby People's Voice Award, for Best Use of Photography. Just one example of our innovation in communication. We are innovating in Afghanistan, where a UNFPA-supported midwifery hotline provides around-the-clock support and guidance to health workers across the country. We are innovating in Mongolia, where an award-winning Telemedicine project enables specialists in the capital to give teleconsultations to provincial doctors and patients hundreds of miles away and to share medical data for analysis. Since its launch, the project has reached at least 60 per cent of all pregnant women in the country. And we think the best measure of its success is that fact that Mongolia is one of only nine countries to have achieved the Millennium Development Goal on reducing maternal deaths. In a multi-country effort, country offices in Moldova, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan are innovating with the private sector to provide accurate and real-time information to young people on access to national services and information.  In the Eastern and Southern Africa region, our Innovation Accelerator programme is providing mentoring and seed funding to help young entrepreneurs like Solomon Kahuma turn innovative ideas into successful ventures that provide homegrown solutions to country-specific sexual and reproductive health challenges. Solomons decision support system, Drug Dash, enables health centres and drug distributors in Uganda to capture real time data on health supplies and consumption to address the persistent problem of under- and overstocking of medicines. Another Ugandan start-up, Eco Smart Pads, is making low-cost sanitary napkins from sugarcane. This not only improves menstrual hygiene, but keeps girls in school. In Malawi and Swaziland, the mobile site Tune me allows young people to ask questions about relationships, family planning options, and information on HIV/AIDS and other sexual and reproductive health issues. This is just one of many similar initiatives around the world using mobile technology to put sexual and reproductive health information at young peoples fingertips. In Mozambique, UNFPA and the Government have launched a real-time monitoring tool to collect disaggregated data on interventions to improve the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents and young people. The new tool, called InfoBiz, helps the Government monitor clinic activities, better understand young peoples needs, and monitor progress. At UNFPA, we see innovation as an indispensable engine for accelerating progress towards delivering on our mandate and achieving the ICPD and 2030 agendas, which are so intertwined. UNFPA has embraced innovation as a corporate priority. The Innovation Fund, supported generously by Denmark and Finland, has been a catalyst for increased organization-wide innovation, regardless of the funding source. In a time of resource constraints and rapid change, it is time to think boldly about how to identify and scale up solutions. But we must do it based on the evidence of what works for whom and in what circumstances. That is why we decided to conduct a formative evaluation of our Innovation Initiative. It provided real-time feedback and learning to managers on implementing the first phase of the Innovation Initiative; it is helping us improve programme design, processes and systems; and to inform this next Strategic Plan. I would like to add that this evaluation is itself an innovation, and the first of its kind in the UN system. As part of this evaluation exercise, UNFPA commissioned a comparative analysis of innovation across the UN system, collecting and comparing data from 11 UN agencies and offices. By taking stock of our collective experiences to date, we hope this study will foster mutual learning, facilitate strengthened collaboration, and provide inspiration for the path ahead as we work together to support countries in making real the aims of the Sustainable Development Goals. And I would like to invite all of you to join us just after this mornings session for a side event on innovation at UNFPA. While I am on the subject of evaluation and how central it is to the Fund, let me welcome Mr. Marco Segone, who recently joined UNFPA as Director of the Evaluation Office, after a more than 20-year career with UN Women and UNICEF. Marco has also served as vice-chair and chair of the United Nations Evaluation Group, and we look forward to working with and learning from him. I am also pleased to inform you that Mr. Bjrn Andersson has assumed his duties this week as Regional Director of the UNFPA Asia Pacific Regional Office. I would like to thank Bjrn for his support to the late Executive Director and to the organization over the past four years, as advisor and as Chief of Staff, and during his previous years with the Fund. We wish him well in his new post in Bangkok. Let me also take this opportunity to thank Ms. Yoriko Yasukawa for her leadership of the Asia Pacific region over the past two years and, on behalf of all of us, wish her well in her future endeavors. Finally, I would like to recognize and thank Mr. Stephan Flaetgen, who represented with distinction the staff of UNDP, UNFPA, UNOPS and UN Women in various interagency fora since joining the staff council in 2000 until his retirement last month.  Mr. President, Fully in keeping with the 2030 vision and the Secretary-Generals UN reform efforts, we are working to better align our efforts with sister agencies to protect and empower women and young people, particularly adolescent girls. Because we know that when we do, they and we together can build the better future we all want. In Mozambique, UNFPA, in partnership with UNESCO, UNICEF and UN Women, is supporting a Government-led mentoring programme  Rapariga biz or Busy Girl, which aims to reach 1 million girls with crucial information about their bodies and their rights and also teach them the life skills they need to protect and empower themselves.  So far the results are encouraging, with rates of pregnancy and early marriage among participating girls far below the national average.  UNFPA will continue to partner with UNICEF and UN Women to put an end to gender-based violence and harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation and child marriage. And we do have some good news on that front: the incidence of FGM has declined by around 30 percent over the last three decades. Yet, that progress is not universal. UNFPA and UNICEF together lead the largest global programme to accelerate the abandonment of this injurious practice  working in partnership with governments, health workers, local communities, religious leaders and youth activists, like the Y-Peer youth network in Somalia. Changing entrenched social norms and practices is slow, difficult work that requires patience, persistence and persuasion to change minds and drive action on the ground in community after community. Yet, we believe we that have cause for optimism. We are seeing young people, including young men, speak out against female genital mutilation. We are seeing older people, and even some religious and traditional leaders, who do not want their daughters and partners to be cut. The tide is turning, but we need to rev up and we need to push harder, we need to enlist more communities and families in abandoning the practice, and we need to support and empower more girls to make their voices heard. Adolescent pregnancy is another global challenge. In fact, complications from pregnancy and childbirth are now the leading cause of death among adolescent girls, and debilitating morbidities such as the obstetric fistula are a consequence of too early pregnancy. I want to challenge all of us in this room to redouble our efforts to end the scourge of fistula, which should have no place in todays world. Fistula has been virtually eliminated in the world's wealthier countries, so we know that it can be eliminated in every country. It is achievable if we put our minds and efforts into it, and UNFPA is fully committed to ramping up this effort, together with our partners in the Campaign to End Fistula, as a matter of urgency. In the Philippines, a new campaign Babaenihan, spearheaded by UNFPA in collaboration with Vice President Leni Robredo, engages adolescent girls throughout the country to find solutions to challenges such as teenage pregnancy and calls for greater investment in their education, health and economic opportunities. Most importantly, it gives young women, like 16-year-old Shaina Macmac who dreams of being a doctor, a chance to voice their opinions, explain their challenges and aspirations, and tell us what they need. UNFPA is also working with the government and local partners in El Salvador to increase awareness of factors contributing to teen pregnancy. We are training students, teachers and parents, and organizing workshops for public officials on human rights, gender equality and the protection needs of sexual violence survivors. UNFPA will continue to consolidate and build on our long experience and strengths in delivering in both humanitarian and development contexts. By working to bridge the humanitarian-development divide, we strengthen the resilience of individuals, institutions and societies to contribute to positive outcomes over the long term. In Peru, where over a million people were affected by flooding earlier this year, UNFPA deployed mobile brigades of gynaecologists, obstetricians, psychologists and social workers, and we reached over 10,000 women and girls with life-saving reproductive health services and information on how to identify and prevent dengue, Zika and Chikungunya infections, and protect themselves from GBV.  In Nepal, where recent devastating floods have put vulnerable women and girls at serious risk, UNFPA and our partners are distributing prepositioned dignity kits, conducting reproductive health camps in affected districts, offering antenatal check-ups and other life-saving services.  Turning to Nigeria, where violence has destroyed health facilities and resulted in an alarming shortage of skilled health personnel, UNFPA has been entrusted with providing supplies for safe deliveries, family planning, and equipment to respond to sexual and gender-based violence. We are also training health personnel in the Minimum Initial Service Package, which is a series of actions required to meet reproductive health needs in any crisis setting. In conflict-torn Kasai in the Democratic Republic of Congo, UNFPA mobile clinics are reaching women cut off from health centres with antenatal care, life-saving emergency obstetric interventions, and services to support survivors of gender-based violence. And turning to Syria, so far this year, UNFPA has helped more than 24,000 women with routine deliveries and over 29,000 women with C-sections. UNFPA-supported mobile and static clinics, like the one seen here, have provided tens of thousands of women with reproductive health and GBV services in Aleppo, where the crisis has devastated the health infrastructure. And with support from national partners, UNFPA has been able to deliver hygiene kits and multi-sectoral assistance to beneficiaries throughout Syria, providing the dignity and support women and girls need and deserve. This includes empowering women to help them generate much needed income to support their families, reduce their vulnerability, build resilience and contribute to long-term recovery and sustainable development.  Mr. President, Evidence shows that advancing sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights has multiplier effects that benefit individuals, communities and nations. It shows that when development works for women and young people, especially adolescent girls, it works for everyone. The 2030 horizon gives us an exciting, strategic opportunity to proactively shape and influence our future, together.  UNFPA is engaging to implement change management in a holistic manner to help us hone and achieve strategic goals and institutional effectiveness in line with UN organizational reform and the recommendations of an independent evaluation of our current Strategic Plan. In the new development and funding landscape, UNFPA needs to ensure that we have the right people, with the right skills, deployed in the right places, in position to do the right things at the right cost. As I mentioned during our informal session last week, we are putting in place a governance mechanism led by our Deputy Executive Director of Management, Laura Londn, to ensure the substantive and operational coherence of the various change management initiatives and processes already under way at UNFPA, namely: the Comprehensive Resources Review, the Information and Communication Technologies Strategic Plan, the actual Strategic Plan revised business model implementation, and the UN Reform. Our goal is to ensure that the organizational structure, staffing and budget allocations are all fully aligned to enable optimal implementation of the new Strategic Plan. Currently, the focus is centered on headquarters structures. The next phases will be informed by the specifics of the Secretary-Generals reform process, for which more information should be available by December 2017, and of course, the assumption of duties by the incoming Executive Director of the Fund. The Comprehensive Resources Review is, above all, an internal effort to improve the programmatic capacity of UNFPA, to take into account available resources, and to deliver better. And we will keep the Executive Board apprised of progress in this regard. The 2017 Report on Contributions to UNFPA pointed to a 14% decrease in core and non-core resources between 2015 and 2016, and it projects a further 17% decrease for 2017. This is due largely to exchange rate volatility; to a narrowing funding base for core resources; and to unprecedented reductions from some key traditional donors. And while we have not yet closed the funding gap for this year, we would like to acknowledge several Member States who have committed to doing more for women and girls and have increased core contributions for 2017  countries including Belgium, Israel, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden. And we anticipate that many more will respond to UNFPAs 150 Core Donor Campaign. A few donors, including Belgium and Denmark, have also committed new core funds for next year and beyond. In addition, Canada has just committed a welcome around $32 million in new support for UNFPAs humanitarian response.For all of this we are immensely grateful, as we are to the 18 programme countries who have increased their contributions in 2017  for a total of $72.2 million, as of 1 August 2017, compared to $23.0 million in 2016. In the current development financing context in which ODA constitutes only a fraction of resource flows to meet the 2030 Agenda requirements, UNFPA is vigorously exploring opportunities, partnerships andnew platforms that facilitate programmatic innovation and also financing innovation, including the option of blended financing leveraging different types of international and domestic financing streams. Efforts to engage non-traditional donors and partners led to the mobilization of $13.7 million in 2016  which was a 24% increase over 2015. Initial results for the first half of this year are already showing $8.5 million in contributions from corporations and foundations. Given the current funding situation, however, we have based the Strategic Plan and the Integrated Budget upon conservative income projections. While the needs remain great, the budget is prudent. Our funding targets will remain ambitious, and UNFPA will continue to actively explore and go after opportunities to mobilize further resources beyond these stated targets in order to achieve the ambition of the 2030 Agenda and ensure delivery on our three transformative results. The majority of the resources  75%  are proposed to be allocated to programmes, in support of the achievement of the Strategic Plan outcomes and outputs. The decrease in the resources allocated to programmes is primarily due to the lower overall income the organization is projecting to receive. And any additional resources that we do mobilize will be dedicated to the improved delivery of country programmes. In response to the reduced income, the institutional budget includes a large volume of savings and efficiencies, and absorbs all of the statutory cost increases for the next four years. While the institutional budget does increase, the underlying factors are very distinct, and predominantly driven by Executive Board decisions and/or audit recommendations. Id like to point out that the institutional budget, being the foundation of the organization, supports activities at all UNFPA locations  headquarters, regional and country offices. This is the part of the budget that enables the organization to maintain our universal presence in delivery of our mandate, with more than half of the total institutional budget being spent in the field. Following extensive consultations with and advice from Member States, UNFPA proposes now to defer the establishment of the Premises Capital Plan, which is requested by the Board of Auditors, and at this point we will bring it back for consideration at the next budget revision. This will reduce the proposed institutional budget to USD 708.4 million, or 19.8 percent, and increase the funds available for programmes by USD 14 million. Our clear assurance is that UNFPA will continue the dialogue and keep the Executive Board fully informed as to how this balance in delivery at the country level is going to be vigorously pursued during the course of the Strategic Plan and, of course, in concert with and under the direction of the incoming Executive Director, once named. We are proposing to brief the Executive Board in the first part of next year on the progress of work being undertaken in relation to the Comprehensive Resources Review and to respond to any issues, which are being raised by Member States following informal briefings which we will set up in the early part of 2018. Subject to the decision of the new Executive Director on the results of the Comprehensive Resources Review, we will submit a report to the Annual Session 2019, and have a timeline that ensures that the Board's mid-term review of the Strategic Plan can take into account further changes, following the adoption of the Strategic Plan and Institutional Budget at this Second Regular Session, if so done.  Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, This new UNFPA Strategic Plan is a source of pride for all of us in UNFPA. Why? Because it is a wellspring of promises we shall keep in promoting the wellbeing of the women and girls we champion together. We hope it is a source of pride for you as well because, indeed, it is as much your plan as it is ours. Together, we have developed a solid, forward-looking Plan based on evidence, lessons learned and vision, and we very much look forward to its adoption. We have come a long way together, and I believe that we have strengthened our relationship on a strong foundation of trust, goodwill, mutual respect and collaboration. With your support we weathered two great storms this year: our defunding by a key donor, which was followed by the untimely loss of our Executive Director, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin. We have worked with you and we have heard your concerns. And we know that UNFPA must change  change with the times. And we know that we have proceeded on that path and that we are already doing a lot. UNFPA staff are on the front line  in many cases putting their lives are on the line to defend the health and rights of women and young people. And we are defending the poorest and the most marginalized, those continuously left behind  women and adolescent girls facing child birth in conflict zones or on the move; girls at risk of child marriage, female genital mutilation or any form of sexual or gender-based violence. In some of the most inhospitable environments on earth, UNFPA staff face head-on the opposition we see to our mandate at the global level, and yet they persist in delivering life-saving services. This, too, is an enormous bedrock for us. The multifaceted change management process we are currently undertaking is going to require bold innovation; its going to require consolidation of our efforts; we are going to need to improve efficiency, collaborate more effectively, and expand UNFPAs reach so that we can do more and do it better, and we can deliver on our promise to the worlds women, girls and young people. We are very excited about the work that is under way, just as we are about our new strategic vision. And in rolling out the Strategic Plan, we will model the change we want to see  consolidation, innovation, collaboration in teams across all levels of the organization, and communicating about the change process to all audiences, both internal and external, and doing so in a spirit of accountability, openness and transparency. We occupy a difficult space at a particularly challenging time. We are being pushed and pulled in different directions  by, on the one hand, those who would seek to reverse the progress we have made  who seek to curtail reproductive rights and womens domain over their own bodies and lives, and those pushing us to do more and do it better and to go further. Now more than ever we will need your political and financial support and your networks to continue to advance together towards our central goal, which remains universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. Together, we need to build on the momentum generated by movements like She Decides, like the African Union Demographic Dividend theme this year, and like the London Family Planning summit, which galvanized and gathered attention and political will to show the resources necessary to bring real and lasting change to women, adolescent girls and young people.   Mr. President,  Distinguished Delegates, In these trying times when the UNFPA mandate is under threat, as Acting Executive Director, I can assure you that myself and my team in every corner of the world are constantly working hard to extend the reach of UNFPA to mobilize the financial and the moral wherewithal to vigorously defend the fundamental rights of women and girls to their sexual and reproductive health. We of UNFPA must be vocal, visible and vigilant in defending the Member States approved focus on sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including family planning, as well as on the demographic dividend and youth empowerment. In the new sustainable development era, UNFPA must use the power of data and evidence to convince the skeptics and rally people of good will to our side. We feel this is fully in keeping with Secretary-Generals reforms and the recommendations of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review, and we must engage skillfully, efficiently and cost-effectively with countries to ensure maximum coverage with value for money. These are worthy ideals to which I myself and all of us in UNFPA are devoted as a mission and as a life's passion. Because no one should be left behind. We want to partner for equality. We want to promote safety and dignity for every woman and girl  and to lead with a purpose. Our mission and mandate, enshrined in the ICPD Programme of Action and reaffirmed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, where every childbirth is safe and where every young persons potential is fulfilled. By 2030 we aspire to: zero unmet need for family planning; zero maternal deaths; and zero violence against women, including harmful practices. Our actions will help ensure the sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights of every woman and girl! Because the future indeed belongs to the 10-year-old girl! Let us prepare her and empower her, and boys too, to help us all build a more just, equitable, sustainable future  a future of health and well-being and prosperity for all. Thank you.     "
NA,"press","05 June 2018","    Speech  Statement of the Executive Director to the Annual Session of the Executive Board 2018 05 June 2018   Mr. President,Distinguished Delegates,Dear Colleagues Good morning! It is a pleasure to join you for this Annual Session of the Executive Board. I am very appreciative that the discussions since last Friday have been so constructive and forward-looking. And I am also very appreciative to Member States for yesterdays touching moment of remembrance and celebration of the life of Dr. Babatunde. Mr. President, The UNFPA strategic plan for 2014-2017 set ambitious targets for increasing access to sexual and reproductive health services, including  and especially  in parts of the world torn apart by war or devastated by natural disasters. These services have empowered millions of women to make their own decisions about whether, when or how often to become pregnant. They have enabled millions of teenagers to avoid unplanned pregnancy, and to make safe and healthy transitions to adulthood. And they have slowed the unnecessary and cruel tide of maternal death. I had a chance recently to see firsthand the tremendous humanitarian response by UNFPA during my visit to Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh last month. The services UNFPA is providing to Rohingya refugees in the camps are truly a lifeline for women and girls  many of whom have suffered unimaginable hardship, brutality, and often, sexual violence. One by one the women and girls I met spoke to me about the difference our Shanti Khana, or havens of peace, that we have in the camps have made in their lives. As one woman said to a case worker upon arrival at one of the UNFPA women-friendly safe spaces: I walked for 30 minutes to reach this peace house, not for food, not for medicine, but to find inner peace so I can continue with my life. This is the life-transforming work UNFPA is doing in humanitarian settings around the world, helping restore peace of mind, health and well-being for countless women and girls, creating safe spaces, providing psychosocial support, handing out hygiene and protection items in our dignity kits, setting up health clinics and deploying midwives. Ensuring, in the words of our campaign, Safe BirthEven Here. Even here in a refugee camp, or in conflict, or on the move. The annual report that you have before you highlights our accomplishments over the past four years. And I am proud to say that UNFPA made steady progress towards achieving the results that we set for ourselves in our previous strategic plan. Overall, 58 million women and young people in UNFPA priority countries utilized integrated sexual and reproductive health services during the strategic plan period 2014 to 2017. Contraceptives provided by UNFPA during this period helped avert nearly 49 million unintended pregnancies, 15 million unsafe abortions, 125,000 maternal deaths and 200,000 new HIV infections. All regions made progress towards achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health and realizing reproductive rights. And the fastest progress was seen in regions that included primarily UNFPA priority countries, except for those regions affected by active humanitarian crises. This was particularly true for the least developed countries  countries that utilized 54 per cent of the UNFPA programme budget. Globally, the maternal mortality ratio declined by 37 per cent between the year 2000 and the year 2015. And the decline in the least developed countries and in countries in East and Southern Africa was steepest in the latter years, between 2010 and 2015. Adolescent childbearing fell by 21 per cent globally between 2000 and 2015, with a particularly sharp drop in Southern Asia, where adolescent births fell by more than half. And again, we saw the pace of decline accelerate in the latter five years, between 2010 and 2015. So this is very good news. We also have good news on child marriage, which declined in all regions. Around 2010, one in three women between the ages of 20 and 24 had been married before the age of 18. By around 2017, that ratio had dropped to one in five. For girls under age 15, the decline was four times faster between 2010 and 2017 than in the preceding five years. Progress in satisfying unmet need for family planning also accelerated between 2010 and 2017 in the least developed countries and sub-Saharan Africa. And partnerships have been one of the keys to this success. Thanks to the Family Planning 2020 partnership, for example, whose reference group UNFPA co-chairs, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, more than 309 million women and adolescent girls in 69 of the worlds poorest countries were using modern contraception by 2017. And births by skilled attendants increased by 12 per cent between 2010 and 2016. Here again, the increase was fastest in the least developed countries. In Southern Asia, it almost doubled. We saw significant progress in our key results for adolescents and youth  progress in laws, policies, advocacy and programming. As one example  38 countries aligned national comprehensive sexuality education curricula with international standards. Another example  1.3 million marginalized girls in UNFPA programme countries benefited from life-skills programming in 2017. With regard to gender equality, womens and girls empowerment and reproductive rights, we saw a change in awareness and attitudes in several programme countries. In a number of countries, for example, the perception that a man would be justified in hitting or beating his wife or partner was well on the decline. The prevalence of female genital mutilation also declined. With support from the UNFPA-UNICEF joint programme on female genital mutilation/cutting, nearly 9,000 communities publicly declared the abandonment of female genital mutilation over the past four years. This translates into more than 800,000 girls, who are now growing up free from this harmful practice. Finally, when it comes to population data and analysis, which is the bedrock of UNFPA programming, 90 per cent of the national development plans developed during the strategic plan period addressed population dynamics. A number of countries integrated the demographic dividend into their national plans, while other countries developed strategies and policies on ageing and integrated the rights of the older persons into their national policies and programmes. And 135 countries implemented the 2010 census round, strengthened their population data systems, and most importantly, used census data to inform policies and programmes. I hope you will be able to join us for the special briefing on Population Dynamics and Sustainable Development in the Europe and Central Asia Region, which will follow this mornings session. UNFPA is pleased to co-host this event because this region is at the forefront of a global demographic transformation, which has big implications for sustainable development, as well as individual health, rights and wellbeing. Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, As I said, partnerships played a very important role in the achievement of these results. That includes our partnership with you and your governments, and I thank you for your support, collaboration and guidance. As a result, year on year, millions of women, adolescents and young people around the world have been progressively able to exercise their sexual and reproductive health and rights. It is clear that we have made concrete progress. This is a testament to the work of our teams on the ground and also to our partnership with you as Board members. You have given your time and have patiently worked with us to build an organization that is more responsive, efficient, effective and innovative. Yet, we know we still have a ways to go to achieve all the results we have set for ourselves. Untold millions of women and girls are still at risk of unintended pregnancy, of death in pregnancy or childbirth, or practices that keep girls from realizing their full potential. In 2018, this is simply unacceptable. And that is why, as we move forward, we are using the lessons learned over the past four years to strengthen and expand our efforts to deliver even stronger results during the current strategic plan period, 2018 to 2021. Where there are gaps, we are addressing them through an integrated programme support initiative, already under way and connecting country, regional and headquarters colleagues. This has been possible also thanks to a strong evaluation function, as reported by the Director of Evaluation. In 2017, 95 per cent of UNFPA evaluations were rated as of good quality or above; 100 per cent of evaluations had management responses, of which 84 per cent were implemented. By investing in good quality evaluations, and making sure that they are used for decision making, we are making UNFPA stronger and better able to deliver strong results. We continue to be ambitious, and we are guided by our overall goal of universal access to sexual and reproductive health and the realization of reproductive rights. UNFPA held its senior leadership meeting in March, where we had a series of energizing and strategic discussions. Our leadership is passionate, committed and focused on working in true partnership to achieve by 2030 the three transformative results outlined in our new strategic plan. Together we are determined to end preventable maternal deaths, end unmet need for family planning, and end harmful practices and violence against women and girls, basing our efforts on quality population data and analysis to leave no one behind. And we are using these three results to drive partnership, advocacy and resource mobilization. Currently, we are doing so through a private giving campaign for Rohingya refugees with our Goodwill Ambassador Ashley Judd, part of our Safe Birth Even Here initiative. I invite you to turn now to a very brief video about the campaign from Ashleys trip to Coxs Bazar earlier this year. We are enormously grateful to Ashley Judd for shedding light on the plight of Rohingya women and girls and the strong need for increased support. We also thank her for generously committing to match the individual donations received. Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, On the subject of funding, let me say how pleased and grateful we are for the support provided by Member States to UNFPA in 2017. And I thank those who have already committed to funding UNFPA in 2018. We are hopeful that we will meet our targets this year, but more efforts are needed to ensure the Strategic Plan is fully funded for its entire four-year duration. This is key to set UNFPA on the path to meet our three transformative results by the year 2030. To this end, we are intensifying our Funding Dialogue, and we encourage all Member States to engage.  We would also like to encourage Member States to make their contributions early in the year to enable better planning. Moreover, multi-year core commitments are truly the best investment you can make in UNFPA to ensure sustainable, lasting results. We applaud all donors who so far have been able to increase support to UNFPA in 2018  among them, Norway, Italy and New Zealand. In particular, I would like to thank Sweden for its new multi-year commitment of more than 278 million USD over the duration of the strategic plan from 2018 to 2021. The downward trend in core funding remains a challenge, and Sweden's contribution will go a long way towards ensuring UNFPA is fit to deliver on our three ambitious results and the achievement of universal sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. We hope that Sweden's example, and Belgiums example, will inspire others to commit to multi-year core funding. Every contribution is important, and is a sign of political support for the rights of women and girls. We hope that this year we can reach 150 contributors to core funding. For non-core funding, many donors have stepped up. I particularly want to thank Canada and Australia for significant new support. Canada has increased support to UNFPAs humanitarian response, and UNFPA and Australia have concluded a new transformative agenda in support of women and girls in the Pacific. Mr. President, We are hard at work to ensure the UNFPA funding architecture is best equipped to deliver our strategic plan results. This evening, we are introducing a new Humanitarian Action Thematic Fund. Humanitarian funding needs remain high, and we continue to face a gap in funding of around 50 per cent. The past four years witnessed unprecedented increases in the scope, frequency and complexity of humanitarian emergencies. By 2017, 128 million people needed humanitarian services, in comparison to 76 million people in 2014. In the midst of complex and challenging crises, in Syria, Yemen, northeast Nigeria, and other countries, we at UNFPA were able to ramp up our humanitarian operations and achieve significant results between 2014 and 2017. With UNFPA support, 41 million women and adolescent girls in more than 70 countries were reached with services for sexual and reproductive health and to prevent and address gender-based violence. A continuing source of pride for me is the humanitarian leadership being demonstrated by UNFPA humanitarian teams in some of the most complex and dangerous settings on earth, and I know that with your support our teams will continue to stand and deliver for women and girls everywhere. Another thing that were proud of is UNFPAs unwavering commitment to advancing young peoples health, well-being and rights, including their right to participation. As part of the UN-wide initiatives on youth, UNFPA is committed to continue co-leading the work on Youth, Peace and Security, and the Compact on Youth in Humanitarian Action. These will be embedded in the overarching UN Youth Strategy with its scope reflecting the consensus of the United Nations system on the collective agenda for young people. We at UNFPA are very proud to have supported, in partnership with the Peacebuilding Support Office, the development of The Missing Peace: Independent Progress Study on Youth, Peace and Security, which was mandated by Security Council resolution 2250 in 2015. Last month, the Security Council organized an Open Debate on the study, whose findings reinforce the call of the ICPD Programme of Action and its reviews for meeting the needs and aspirations of youth, and ensuring their participation in the political process and their preparation for leadership roles. This study amplifies the voices of young people and highlights the multiple ways that young people are working for peace and security, and I commend our staff for their work in bringing this important and timely endeavor to fruition. Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, Advancing the ICPD and 2030 agendas requires action and stronger partnerships. And this is exactly where we are focusing our efforts so that we  working together with United Nations, with civil society, and with private sector partners  can better support countries' national development, humanitarian action and peacebuilding. Implementing the new strategic plan, while navigating the shifting funding environment and the ongoing UN Reform, will also require a change in the way that UNFPA supports intergovernmental and multilateral processes. Over the past several months, we have heard the very valuable views expressed by many of you, calling for a more coherent, systematic approach to this work, an approach informed by evidence, data, multi-disciplinary thinking and national practices. I have also heard your calls for us to further support national institutions to strategically engage in intergovernmental processes, ensuring the nexus between these processes and programme implementation at the country level. This has led to a decision to revisit the way that UNFPA is structured to carry out this work. As I alluded to earlier this month during my meeting with the Bureau of the Board and during last weeks informal session, this will entail realigning the current structures of the Division of Governance and Multilateral Affairs (DGM) within the broader structures of the Fund, including  for example  the transfer of the Executive Board Branch from DGM to the Executive Office. Last week, I circulated  one month ahead of schedule - my vision for this work. The envisaged changes will be fully implemented by September of this year, by which time I will provide additional updates on this aspect to the Board. As we implement these changes, our top priority is to ensure continuity in our work and in our support to Member States. As I have stated before, the Comprehensive Resources Review was not intended as a simple cost-cutting exercise. Rather, we have striven to ensure that UNFPA is fit for purpose. We count on the Boards continued engagement and support, as we work to equip UNFPA to deliver on the expectations of the new Strategic Plan, of the 2030 Agenda and of the UN Reform  all while implementing changes to ensure optimal use of UNFPA resources at Headquarters, at regional offices, in our liaison offices and country offices. I would also like to add that, at our recent leadership meeting, senior staff across all levels of the organization pledged to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse at UNFPA. This is something we are taking seriously, and I am personally committed to making zero tolerance a reality. Towards this end, as many of you will know, I have designated Laura Londn, Deputy Executive Director (Management), as the senior focal point for Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassment at UNFPA. At this juncture, I would also like to formally welcome Dereje Wordofa, our new Deputy Executive Director (Programme), to his first Executive Board session. Dereje joined in April, and we are very pleased to have him on board. I would also like to warmly welcome our new Chief of Staff, Pio Smith, who joined UNFPA in March. Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, There is no denying that the sexual and reproductive health and rights agenda is under threat. And we are doing our best to stand strong and tell a powerful story, backed by strong results, about the impact being made to save lives and to uphold human rights. We know that our work in advancing this agenda makes a major contribution to sustainable development. This was backed most recently by the new report of the Guttmacher-Lancet Commission  which is a collaboration of global health, development and human rights experts from around the world  and it calls for accelerated progress towards sexual and reproductive health and rights for all. UNFPA launched this report with the Commission Chairs in Johannesburg on May 9th this year, and its findings galvanized forces at the recent World Health Assembly in Geneva with the focus on health and human rights for all  and for more equitable development. Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, Fifty years ago last month the world proclaimed family planning a basic human right at the first International Conference on Human Rights. We have seen significant progress since then. For the first time in history, nearly 700 million women and adolescent girls in developing countries now use modern contraceptives  the best means of exercising the right to determine the number and spacing of ones children. And yet, with more than 200 million women who want to avoid pregnancy still lacking modern contraceptives, it is clear that we cannot take this right for granted. We still need to defend it every day. All of us at UNFPA are committed to being bold, vocal and visible in defending sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights for all. Next year marks another 50th anniversary. In 2019, UNFPA will celebrate five decades of operations, as the world also marks 25 years since the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. This presents a historic opportunity for the global community to recommit to, to celebrate and to advance the groundbreaking Cairo agenda to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. In the coming months, the United Nations Regional Economic Commissions, with the support of UNFPA and other partners, will undertake reviews of the implementation of the ICPD since the adoption of their respective regional review outcomes in 2013. The results of the reviews will guide implementation in the regions for the next five years and are therefore important for our work to achieve our three transformative results. The regional reports and outcomes will also inform the Secretary-Generals report for the 52nd session of the Commission on Population and Development (CPD) to take place in April 2019. That session will be devoted to the global review and appraisal of the implementation of the ICPD and will also contribute to the High Level Political Forum later on in 2019. The ICPD agenda is central to the efforts of the United Nations to leave no one behind. Therefore, we all have a special responsibility to ensure that the issues, the principles, and the work that underpin the agenda are safeguarded and advanced. These efforts and more are put more at risk when the Commission on Population and Development is unable to find consensus and support our life-saving work. We need your support to ensure that the decisions of next years Commission on Population and Development reinforce the ICPD consensus and enhance the health, well-being and opportunities of women, girls and young people everywhere. For our part, I do assure you that we at UNFPA will not stop until every woman and every girl, across the globe, has the power, information and means to shape her own destiny. A cause worth fighting for, and a mandate that UNFPA defends every day, everywhere. Thank you.   "
NA,"press","03 June 2019","    Speech  Statement of the Executive Director to the Annual Session of the Executive Board 2019 03 June 2019   Mr. President,Distinguished Delegates,Dear Colleagues and Friends, Good morning! It is a pleasure to join you for this Annual Session of the Executive Board. There is a saying: Starting is easy, persevering an art. In this our 50th year, and as we look back on achievements since the landmark International Conference on Population and Development 25 years ago, we have much to be proud of  the result of five decades of passionate perseverance. Together with our partners, we have made steady progress. I thank you, Members of the Executive Board, and your governments for your continued partnership and support. We appreciate and will continue to seek your strategic guidance on the Funds work and priorities. This year, we celebrate the global movement for reproductive rights and choices that began, like UNFPA, in the 1960s, and gained impetus and inspiration in Cairo in 1994. A movement that has transformed the lives of hundreds of millions of women and girls. The ICPD, together with other important global conferences in the 1990s, from Rio to Vienna to Beijing and Copenhagen, provided a unique opportunity to recalibrate development, to integrate human rights and social justice into our thinking and planning and to locate women at the heart of the development agenda. The Millennium Development Goals era followed, and now, there is a real sense that the Sustainable Development Goals are creating the political space to achieve what was envisaged in the mid-1990s through Agenda 2030. At UNFPA, we were encouraged by the 52nd session of the Commission on Population and Development and its Political Declaration reaffirming the ICPD Programme of Action. Delegates agreed that the principles of the ICPD are essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We at UNFPA could not agree more. This means that the global community also needs to acknowledge and affirm that sexual and reproductive health and rights, the core of ICPD, must be part and parcel of Universal Health Coverage. There can be no UHC without sexual and reproductive health. That was my message to the World Health Assembly two weeks ago. It is a message we will continue to make loud and clear as the movement for Universal Health Coverage gains ever greater momentum in the lead up to the high-level meeting on UHC in September. Together with our partners, including Member States, UNFPA is working for the inclusion of an essential package of sexual and reproductive health services within UHC policies, so that national plans and programmes respond to the needs of their people  all their people. We want to achieve the universal in Universal Health Coverage. This means ensuring that health systems are equipped to deliver sexual and reproductive health services to all, regardless of who they are, where they live, their income level or their circumstanceseven when they are displaced by conflict or disaster. Two weeks ago UNFPA cohosted the Oslo Conference on Ending Sexual and Gender-based Violence in Humanitarian Crises. There is widespread recognition that we desperately need to turn the tide on such violence, including rape in war. And there is growing global momentum to do so. UNFPA is committed to strengthening prevention, protecting those at risk and ensuring that survivors get the life-saving sexual and reproductive healthcare and specialized services they needand that are their right. And we will work with OCHA and all our humanitarian partners, and with governments, to do so. In February, I was proud to help launch the Spotlight Initiative in the Pacific, on behalf of the core UN partners and together with EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica. Together, with the added impetus and resources Spotlight brings in support of country-led action, I am confident that we can empower a new generation of women and girls to live the lives they choose, free of violence and with full dignity and respect. I also had the pleasure on a number of occasions, including in the Pacific, to engage with youth activists on protecting the rights of young persons, especially those with disabilities. And our journey continues.to the Women Deliver conference in Vancouver opening todayto the Youth Ministers conference in Lisbon later this monthto the High-Level Political Forum in July and other important global gatherings in the months aheadand finally, all roads lead to Nairobi for the Summit on ICPD25 in November. I thank the Governments of Kenya and Denmark for their political and financial support as co-conveners of the Summit. Partnership is crucial to mobilize the momentum and concrete commitments needed to deliver on the promise of Cairo for all with an urgency commensurate to the task at hand. We count on the political and financial support of other Member States to make the Nairobi Summit a resounding success. We urge you to join us and to come to Nairobi with strong commitments. The clock is ticking towards 2030. Its time for everyone to step up the pace. Universality is a guiding principle of the ICPD Programme of Action: everyone has a right to sexual and reproductive health. Rights and choices for all  our mantra, on the road to Nairobi, to 2030 and beyond. Thats also why UNFPAs work on data is so important  so we see who is being left behind and understand their needs. To make the invisible, visible. It is the poorest women and girls, and those who experience exclusion and discrimination, who bear the greatest burden of ill health and preventable deaths. They are the ones we need to reach to achieve by 2030 the three transformative results at the heart of the UNFPA strategic plan  our three zeros: zero unmet need for contraception; zero preventable maternal deaths; and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation. All based on a firm foundation of high-quality data to zero in on where needs are greatest and reach those furthest behind. In the first year of implementation of our Strategic Plan 2018-2021, UNFPA laid a solid foundation for getting to zero and in the years ahead we will accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. We have demonstrated good performance and results as the annual report you have before you shows. We have mobilized more resources than ever in support of our work, while continuing to exercise fiscal prudence and improve efficiencies, cohesiveness and synergies to respond to countries needs. We continue to make strides in our comprehensive change process. This will ensure that we have the organizational culture, structure, systems and skills necessary to maximize our partnerships and resources to deliver on our strategic plan. We are pleased to note the very positive overall assessment of UNFPA in the 2017-18 MOPAN report. It recognizes UNFPA as a well-performing organization on a positive trajectory. The assessment revealed continuous and strong operational, programmatic and managerial improvement and acknowledged UNFPAs impact in both development and humanitarian spheres. UNFPA is proud of these hard-won achievements. We are grateful to our donors for the increased volume of support received in 2018, and we appeal to more governments to champion and support UNFPA and our ICPD mandate during this milestone year. This year, help us show that the world stands for rights and choices for all. Investing in UNFPA core resources is one of the best ways to support this vision and the work we do to make it a reality everywhere. Our work builds on the tremendous progress made in recent decades. Yet, this is no time for complacency. This years 50th anniversary issue of the UNFPA State of World Population Report was titled Unfinished Business for a reason. The report offers a timeline of unparalleled history, a half-century replete with steady progress on maternal health and family planning. Work on womens rights and choices is punctuated by great moments of research and discovery, with census and survey support, UNFPA contributions to policy on sexual and reproductive health, and the type of speedy and compassionate humanitarian assistance that ensures dignity for women and girls, in their time of need. Our sights are now squarely set on addressing the unfinished business, on achieving the inclusive, equitable, sustainable, people-centred development the ICPD and the Sustainable Development Goals envision. I believe we are moving in the right direction In 2018, UNFPA focused on equipping countries with the programming, policy and advocacy capacities necessary to address the unfinished business and realize our transformative results. We began reorienting our programmes around the world, with a focus on making contraception accessible to women and young people, enabling women to have healthy pregnancies and safe births, and protecting women and girls from harm. As of 2018, 105 UNFPA country programmes  better than two thirds  had prioritized at least one of the three transformative results, leveraging additional resources and expanding partnerships to accelerate our path to zero. We also strengthened our capacities for data analysis and dissemination to help governments formulate policies to close gaps in services. We made great headway in our humanitarian work. UNFPA continued to strengthen its capacity to respond quickly in emergencies. We established a Humanitarian Response Office and aim to have it fully staffed in mid-2019. I would like to welcome Shoko Arakaki, who joins UNFPA as Director for the new Office based in Geneva. Shoko has a proven track record in the field of humanitarian action, development, peace and security, and we look forward to benefiting from her extensive experience and her dedication to the principle of leaving no one behind. With UNFPA support, last year 15 million people in humanitarian settings received services for sexual and reproductive health and to prevent and address gender-based violence. Reaching women and girls in humanitarian contexts is critical to achieving the three transformative results, with no one left behind. UNFPA assisted 1 million safe deliveries in humanitarian or fragile settings in 2018. Safe birth  everywhere! Its more than a rallying cry, and we see the results every day in countries around the world. Last year, thousands of midwives were trained and deployed with support from UNFPA, helping us bring life-saving services to the women and girls who need such services, wherever they may be. Midwives save lives! To support countries family planning initiatives, in 2018 UNFPA procured the equivalent of a years worth of contraception for about 68 million couples in developing countries. We estimate that family planning commodities provided by UNFPA helped avert more than 30 million unintended pregnancies, nearly 9 million unsafe abortions, more than 6 million sexually transmitted infections, and more than 70,000 maternal deaths. UNFPA provided over 1 billion male condoms alone in 2018. Now, I would like to turn to our efforts towards achieving our third zero, an end to gender-based violence and harmful practices. Thanks to the efforts of UNFPA and our partners, last year nearly 900,000 women and girls subjected to violence had access to medical or psychological support. More than 1.8 million girls received child-marriage prevention or protection services. Just under half a million girls and women accessed services to prevent or address the impact of female genital mutilation. We also saw important policy and legislative action at country level. Armenia developed an action plan to combat gender-biased sex selection. Bangladesh developed a national plan of action to eliminate child marriage. Burkina Faso passed a criminal code law to address violence against women. The Democratic Republic of Congo developed a law to protect vulnerable people, including survivors of sexual violence. Honduras formulated a bill to strengthen comprehensive care for women survivors of gender-based violence and developed policy frameworks for the protection of the rights of indigenous and Afro-Honduran women. These are just some of the results UNFPA achieved in 2018, together with our partners, with countries and with communities. And I am very excited to report that, for the first time, UNFPA is now sharing its programme results publicly. The UNFPA Results Portal illustrates UNFPA's commitment to innovation, transparency, accountability, and above all, results, which we report straight from our country offices. This initiative, a pioneer among UN agencies, is more than an investment in improving transparency and accountability, it is also an investment in engaging the general public in our work. This is a vital strategy for making our goals everyone's goals. By allowing UNFPA and the communities, governments and partners we work with to monitor progress and efficiency, the results portal will help drive evidence-based decisions, optimize investments and, hopefully, achieve better results faster.  Collective learning, knowledge sharing, and mutual accountability are crucial to ensuring that we achieve our goals. By revealing what works, under what circumstances and why (and, just as important, what might not work) evaluation plays a central role. UNFPA appreciates the efforts made by the Evaluation Office to further strengthen the evaluation function, and we welcome the 2018 Annual Report on Evaluation. The implementation rate of corporate evaluations is 100%, and almost half have been joint or system-wide, reflecting a real commitment to the UN reform. The evaluation of the UNFPA response to the Syria crisis provides evidence and lessons learned that will help UNFPA enhance our response to the needs of populations affected by the Syria crisis and improve response capacity to humanitarian crises elsewhere. Mr. President, As UNFPA works with our partners to achieve strong results and reach those furthest behind, we do so in the face of daunting challenges. The past year saw an unprecedented rise in the scope, frequency and complexity of humanitarian emergencies. By the end of 2018, 136 million people required humanitarian aid, compared to 128 million in 2017. Another challenge: climate change. The past four years were the warmest ever recorded. Extreme weather affected 60 million people in 2018. From the Arctic to the Sahel to the Pacific, I have witnessed this with my own eyes. At the same time, rising populism and extremism continue to affect multilateral policies and institutions, the provision of services, and the progressive realization of rights. The last mile is always the most difficult. Leaving no one behind means we all will have to dig deep, to address the social, economic, cultural and political inequalities that are keeping people behind. This is challenging for all of us. The majority of those still waiting on the unfinished business reside in countries with some of the most fragile health systems, high rates of poverty, low literacy, high gender inequality, limited access to modern transport, and populations in some of the hardest-to-reach areas. We have ambitious aims to end unmet need for family planning, end maternal death, and end gender-based violence and harmful practices by 2030. This will require more innovation, better mapping and estimation of needs, new partnerships and funding, and the interdisciplinary approach of One-UN. Our collective success in these areas is integral to the success of the 2030 agenda. So how do we bring in new voices and a broader range of partners, and above all, the robust financing we need to deliver bold, integrated, innovative solutions that drive transformative change for the women and girls still waiting for all that the ICPD and the SDGs promised? This is the task ahead. In the current era of reform, UNFPA is working with our partners to pioneer new solutions, deliver better together and enhance financing for transformative results. This work includes a costing and financing initiative for sexual and reproductive health and rights that will support efforts to fill the tremendous financing gap for the Sustainable Development Goals. With just 11 years left to the 2030 deadline, its time for urgent action and ambitious financing commitments, based on the best available evidence and data. To this end, UNFPA is also working with countries and the UN system to build stronger population data systems that can find the furthest behind, a foremost priority of ICPD that the entire 2030 Agenda depends on. In this milestone year, we have a collective opportunity to recommit to ensuring that everyone everywhere reaps the benefits of this transformative agenda, whose implementation is essential for accelerating progress across all 17 SDGs. The High-level Political Forum and other high-level UN events throughout this year will help galvanize political and financial commitments and action commensurate with our ambitious global goals. Many countries are also facing issues related to low fertility and population ageing. These, too, are real challenges, even as they represent gains of development, including greater human life expectancy and greater freedoms for women and girls. More and more governments have been requesting advice and support from UNFPA on policies and programmes to address and prepare for population ageing and low fertility. Our challenge is to do so in a way that does not undermine the advances countries have made, with UNFPAs support, in providing family planning information and services worldwide, and advocating for womens reproductive rights. If the last 50 years have taught us anything, it is that demographic challenges cannot be confronted by limiting choices, but rather by enhancing rights and expanding choices. Ensuring rights and choices for all at all ages requires working across sectors. No more silos! This means bringing the health sector together with the education, gender, population, and development sectors, with ministries of the treasury and finance, and providing integrated support to national planning ministries for coordinated action across sectors. This holistic approach is also at the heart of our efforts to help countries achieve the demographic dividend. UNFPA is committed to assisting countries in addressing all these challenges via a life cycle approach that ensures that every young person today can fulfil her potential as she transitions from childhood to adolescence to adulthood and, finally, into old age. Because the evidence shows that when all people attain the empowerment, education, and employment vital to harmonize their reproductive and productive lives, individuals, societies and countries prosper. The midterm review of the strategic plan in 2020 will provide an opportunity for UNFPA to prioritize addressing these very complex challenges, which do have solutions, as we scale up our efforts to ensure that the three transformative results can be achieved globally by 2030. Mr. President, In 2018, UNFPA continued to harness innovation and partnership, including with the private sector, to create and scale up data-driven, sustainable, open solutions to bring about transformative change for and with women, adolescents and young people. From mHealth solutions to data innovations and more, UNFPA is committed to expanding the possible to transform the lives of those we serve. Our approach to innovation can be seen in Burkina Faso, where 6 million people lack proof of identity. UNFPA is partnering with the Government and a tech start-up to help parents register their newborns digitally so that they can access basic services. We are also partnering with the World Food Programmes Innovation Accelerator to support UNFPAs in-house entrepreneurs in launching new ventures that can help us deliver even greater change. Innovation also contributes to UNFPA efforts to strengthen our relationships with United Nations partner agencies so that we all deliver more and deliver better together. The empowered, independent Resident Coordinator (RC) system is central to the repositioning of the UN development system. UNFPA is taking partnerships with the RC system to the next level to advance progress towards the ICPD, the Sustainable Development Goals and other collective results. This includes implementation of the common chapter of the strategic plans of UNFPA, UNDP, UNICEF and UN Women. A dedicated UNFPA strategy focused on engaging with Resident Coordinators is helping our staff and Representatives add strategic value within the broader UN context. It also defines our value proposition at the country level and the cross-cutting nature of our work. In many countries we see Resident Coordinators championing UNFPA priorities, keeping the focus on rights, advocating for UNFPAs engagement in joint resource mobilization, and supporting UNFPAs leadership role in the UNSDCF and Joint Work Plans. Our objective is to capitalize on the repositioning to mobilize the UN system around UNFPAs three transformative results. In this context, we see the RCs as amplifiers and enablers of our work on the ground. We are pleased to note that the UNDAFs developed in 2018 put our three zeros front and centre, with 50 per cent prioritizing ending the unmet need for family planning; 69 per cent prioritizing ending preventable maternal deaths; and 85 per cent prioritizing ending gender-based violence and harmful practices. The RC systems ability to deliver more strategic and better integrated results is interlinked with the redesign of UNDAF, now known as the UNSDCF or the Cooperation Framework  a process UNFPA is proud to have co-led. UNFPA will proactively support the RCs and UN Country Teams to coordinate and lead the cooperation framework planning process. We are committed to the implementation of UN development system reform. As discussed during the Joint Meeting of the Executive Boards last Friday, we are working together with UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women and others to build on the lessons we have learned and to strengthen our impact on the ground. As I stated last Friday at the joint session on the topic of prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, we also continue to strengthen our capacity to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment, and we made significant strides in this direction in 2018. We have strengthened victim support and accountability, and revised our policy on the prohibition of harassment and abuse of authority, in line with UN system best practices. A joint external review, together with UNDP and UNOPS, confirmed the overall adequacy of ourinstitutionalframework for ensuring a victim-centered approach to the prevention of sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment. Our priorities for 2019 include further strengthening of in-country mechanisms for safe reporting, quality survivor assistance and accountability. We are committed to creating a respectful organizational culture and work environment, free of any kind of harassment or abuse, where everyone feels safe and free to raise concerns without fear of abuse or reprisal. Mr. President, Since 1994, governments, activists, civil society organizations, academia and institutions such as UNFPA have rallied behind the Programme of Action and pledged to tear down barriers that have stood between women and girls and their rights and choices. Yet, too many women and girls still are not enjoying their rights. Not the more than 800 women who die every day in pregnancy or giving birth Not the more than 200 million women who want to prevent pregnancy but lack access to modern contraception... Not the one woman in three subjected to physical or sexual violence... Nor the 200 million girls and women who have been subjected to female genital mutilation or the 33,000 girls forced to marry every day. Making reproductive rights and choices a reality for all is going to take each and every one of us. Were all part of this tapestry of actions. All countries, all donors, all civil society and multilateral organizations, all community and youth leaders, all parliamentarians, all international financial institutions and the private sector. I urge all of us to arrive in Nairobi with concrete commitments. This is not a conference, it is a launching pad for commitments about what really matters to the millions women and girls who depend upon our advocacy and material support. Lets recommit to meeting womens urgent need for contraception; to ending preventable maternal deaths; to stopping sexual and gender-based violence and ending female genital mutilation and child marriage, including during humanitarian crises. Yes, lets look at how far weve come. Much more important: lets recommit to completing the unfinished business that will bring us to where we want to be by 2030  a world of rights and choices for everyone, no matter who you are, in full equality and in all our beautiful diversity. I close with the words of Dr. Nafis Sadik, former Executive Director of UNFPA who presided over the International Conference on Population and Development. Describing the path to sustainable development, she said: People are at the heart of the process, as agents and as beneficiaries. We have it in our power to lighten their burdens, remove obstacles in their path and permit them the full flowering of their potential as human beings. That is the moral and ethical basis of the ICPD.  People, their rights and their choices, these remain the moral and ethical basis of UNFPAs work. And we are committed to bringing the promise of Cairo to every person on the planet. I am confident that together we shall do so, with your support, with your commitment and your partnership, and with our collective and passionate perseverance. Thank you very much.   "
NA,"press","23 January 2019","Speech  Statement of the Executive Director to the First Regular Session of the Executive Board 2019 23 January 2019   Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board, Colleagues and friends, Good morning! A very happy new year to each and every one of you. First, allow me to congratulate Ambassador Cho Tae-yul of the Republic of Korea on his election as President of the Executive Board. A warm welcome also to the rest of the Bureau, Ambassador Besiana Kadare of Albania, who begins her second year as a Bureau member, Ambassador Walton Webson of Antigua and Barbuda, Ambassador Collen Kelapile of Botswana, and Ambassador Geraldine Byrne Nason of Ireland. We look forward to working closely with all of you in the year ahead. And heartfelt thanks to Ambassador Jagdish Koonjul of Mauritius and the outgoing Bureau for their guidance, partnership and trust throughout 2018.  Mr. President, The new year is a time for reflection, resolution and renewal. For UNFPA, this year is a significant one. We join the international community in marking 25 years since the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo. Its also our 50th anniversary, the golden jubilee of UNFPA. So 2019 is a time for stock-taking, for strengthening our resolve and our partnerships, and for ambitious action. Its a time to reflect on fundamental questions. Have we done justice to the vision that world leaders articulated nearly 25 years ago in Cairo? What have we achieved? Where is progress lagging? For whom? And why? Fewer women around the world are dying in pregnancy and childbirth. More women are using modern contraception. More girls are in school. Yet, millions of others are still waiting. The series of five successful regional reviews of the ICPD in 2018 kicked off the process of reflection. They reveal the strong results UNFPA and our partners are achieving across the globe. In April, the Commission on Population and Development will conduct a full review of the ICPD Programme of Action and its contribution to the 2030 Agenda, based on these regional reviews. This will, in turn, inform the first full review of the 2030 Agenda in the UN General Assembly. We will also launch The State of World Population 2019 in the coming months. This years report documents the challenges women and girls have faced in claiming their rights and choices over the past 50 years, and it demonstrates how UNFPA and others have helped overcome these challenges. So that is our reflection. Now for our resolution. UNFPA is committed to reenergizing and expanding the global movement for rights and choices for all. Its time to make sexual and reproductive health and rights a priority for a new generation whose rights are at stake. This is essential for UNFPA to achieve, together with our partners, our 3 transformative results  zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths, and zero violence and harmful practices against women and girls. And it is how  together  the world will fulfill the promise of Cairo and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. A series of high-level events commemorating our two milestones this year, and political channels such as the CPD, the High Level Political Forum and the General Assembly, offer an important opportunity for all of us to recommit to fulfilling that promise, to assume shared responsibility and partner like never before to reap the benefits of this transformative agenda. Young activists are already helping reignite the movement, bringing new ideas and new energy. It is they who will carry the torch in the years to come  and a very intrepid group will carry a symbolic torch from Cairo to Nairobi later this year to raise awareness of the worlds collective journey over the past 25 years. They will carry the torch to Nairobi because the capstone event of 2019 will be The Nairobi Summit on ICPD25: Accelerating the Promise, to be co-convened by UNFPA and the Government of Kenya from 13 to 15 November. This high-level Summit will bring together Heads of State, Ministers, civil society and youth leaders, parliamentarians, public and private sector representatives, and many others. Our aim is to galvanize partnerships, to mobilize political and financial support and to help foster ideas and commitments to fully realize the goals of the ICPD. In the lead up to the Summit, we will organize a series of regional and national conversations, bringing together ICPD champions and thought leaders across sectors and experiences to stimulate new thinking and solutions applicable to 21st-century realities and regional and national priorities. The outcomes will be presented at the Nairobi Summit in November. Reflection, resolution, renewal.  Mr. President, Renewal also relates to the current era of reform. We at UNFPA are renewing ourselves internally, and we are renewing our relationships within the UN system to deliver more and deliver better  together. In support of the UN development system reform and to best equip UNFPA to deliver on its strategic plan, I am pleased to report that we are moving ahead, as planned, with our comprehensive change process. This will ensure that we have the organizational culture, structure, systems and skills necessary to deliver with our partners on the 2030 Agenda. The new vision for intergovernmental and interagency affairs has been fully implemented, and the renamed Policy and Strategy Division integrates these functions. Work is also in progress to ensure that the new Humanitarian Office is fully functioning by the second quarter of 2019. The office will have presence in both Geneva and New York and will bolster UNFPAs capacity in humanitarian settings. Sincere thanks to the Government of Switzerland for its support in this process. New change initiatives, aligned with key Strategic Plan outputs related to management of resources, programming for results, and advocacy and partnerships, will be implemented in 2019. They include a realignment of Headquarters, Regional and Sub-regional Office functions, a review of the existing Liaison Office architecture, and a look at more coordinated management of core and non-core resources. We are mindful of the fact that culture change is a necessary condition for all other organizational changes to stick. We are investing, with support from key partners, in work to analyze our current culture and to design the culture that we want and need. I will personally lead this initiative, and I am very happy about the potential and opportunity culture change represents for the organization. A strong shared culture creates an environment where staff is engaged, committed and capable of taking the lead, enhancing operational flexibility. I am very confident that all of these changes will result in an even more agile, integrated, innovative, and results-oriented UNFPA.  UN Reform As I mentioned, these internal changes are aligned with and aim to support ongoing UN reforms. 2019 is also a critical year for the UN development system and its transformation to better support countries to implement the 2030 Agenda. As we mark our two milestones of the ICPD+25 and UNFPA at 50, UN Reform comes at the perfect time for accelerating progress across the Sustainable Development Goals and the ICPD Programme of Action. UNFPA will capitalize on UN reform as an enabler and opportunity to deliver on our Strategic Plan and advance our goal of achieving universal sexual and reproductive health and the realization of reproductive rights. Expectations are very high because 2030 is around the corner. Our three transformative results are essential accelerators for the achievement of Agenda 2030, and we are intensifying investments in strategic partnerships to scale up programmes and results along with the rest of the system. We continue to work on strengthening health systems in collaboration with the H6 health partnership and with Every Woman Every Child. We will build on the momentum created by the movement for universal health coverage to promote universal sexual and reproductive health and rights in all contexts, including in humanitarian settings. We believe that universal health coverage must include a comprehensive package of sexual and reproductive health services, and we are working together with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners on the UHC Impact Framework to ensure that sexual and reproductive health targets and indicators are fully included and that progress is measured. Sexual and reproductive health services, including contraception, are integral to primary health care. This was recognized in the Astana Declaration on Primary Health Care endorsed last year. TheDeclaration, along with theGlobal Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-Being for All,will inform the UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting on Universal Health Care in September. UNFPA is proud to partner with 11 other global health organizations on the Global Action Plan, which defines collective efforts to deliver more efficient support with countries. UNFPA, UN Women and UNDP have joined forces with the European Union and other partners to launch the Spotlight Initiative to end all forms of violence against women by 2030. And in our effort to eliminate harmful practices, UNFPA will accelerate our joint programmes with UNICEF on child marriage and to end female genital mutilation. We continue to bring our long experience in working with and for young people to system-wide efforts in this area, in collaboration with the Secretary-Generals Youth Envoy, UNICEF and many other partners. This includes providing guidance and support in the context of the Secretary-Generals Youth Strategy; Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security; the Compact for Young People in Humanitarian Action and other initiatives. We are now working on a costing of our three transformative results to build sound investment cases, in line with Agenda 2030. We are partnering on this with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, Avenir Health, Victoria University, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and other institutions. The resulting estimates and tools will equip us to build, advocate and fundraise for these investment cases at the global, regional and country level. Moreover, this costing exercise will feed into UN system-wide processes aimed at creating tangible solutions to achieve the SDGs. Enhanced UN system collaboration and coordination will also help us to more comprehensively address demographic changes and population dynamics related to youth, migration, urbanization, ageing and harnessing the demographic dividend. And the UNDP / UNICEF / UN Women and UNFPA Common Chapter of our Strategic Plans will help us to increase coverage, resources, visibility and the results-driven impact that we all wish to see. UNFPAs policy and normative support to countries remains critically important, responding to Member States requests. This work continues to be a priority for UNFPA, and an essential contribution to integrated UN system support at the country level. As discussed during our informal session last week, UNFPA executive management has been entrusted to coordinate two important processes that are critical to enabling change on the ground and to maximizing opportunities offered by the reform: 1) the UN Sustainable Development Groups Strategic Financing Results Group (SFRG), together with UNCTAD, and 2) the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) re-design, with UNESCO. The new generation of UNDAFs will focus on national ownership and implementation of Agenda 2030, stronger alignment with programming instruments and improvement of analytical components. I am pleased to report that this process is moving along quite well. The Strategic Financing Results Group, which I co-chair together with the Secretary-General of UNCTAD, is also making significant steps forward. The Group is developing principles of engagement and a system-wide data standard to enable comparable reporting and analysis of financial data across all agencies. Work is also under way to create an interactive platform for knowledge management, expand the financing tool box and train UN staff to ensure the necessary financial literacy. UNFPA fully embraces the reform. Because in the end, it is about delivering more efficiently and effectively for the people we serve  for every woman and girl, everywhere. We are committed to sharing our experience and expertise, and we will continue working to strengthen collaboration for development, humanitarian action and peace, so that work in each area reinforces overall progress and improves living standards for more and more people around the world.  PSEA and sexual harassment We also continue to collaborate with our partners in the UN system and beyond on coordinated actions to end sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment. This remains a key priority for UNFPA. We work closely with the Office of the Special Coordinator, the Victim Rights Advocate as well as the Inter-Agency Steering Committee (IASC) and actively support and contribute to inter-agency reform initiatives at all levels. Internally, UNFPA has strengthened our structure for the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse at country and regional levels. We have put in place a harmonized Focal Point system with clear roles and responsibilities across the organization. We have also strengthened management accountability by introducing a compliance certification on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse for managers at every level. UNFPA recently initiated a mapping exercise of services available to survivors of gender-based violence in humanitarian settings so that this information can be made available to and used by our partners working to support victims of sexual exploitation and abuse. And in December 2018, we issued a revised policy on Prohibition of Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Abuse of Authority and Discrimination. Aligned with the CEB Model Policy on Sexual Harassment, it reflects a system-wide approach to support victims of sexual harassment and other abusive conduct and to ensure those who engage in such conduct are held fully accountable.  Evaluation UNFPA has a long history of working to address gender-based violence. These efforts have accelerated in recent years, including through partnerships like the Spotlight Initiative. Our current strategic plan features a dedicated output on gender based violence and, for the first time, one capturing the harmful practices of child marriage, female genital mutilation, and son preference. You have before you the first-ever evaluation of UNFPA support to the prevention of, response to and elimination of GBV and harmful practices. It provides critical evidence to enhance UNFPAs capacity to deliver results in this area of work. This will be discussed, along with the revised UNFPA evaluation policy, during the evaluation segment this afternoon. As we strive to reach our 3 zeroes, evaluation helps us zero in on and clearly understand what works, and why. The revised evaluation policy provides clear direction for the scope of, and approaches to, evaluation at UNFPA, and it has the full support of UNFPA senior management and leadership across all levels of the organization. I thank the Board for your guidance and feedback throughout the revision process. We look forward to working with you to make the evaluation function at UNFPA even more relevant and effective for a stronger UNFPA and stronger results for women and girls. Knowledge management is also key to enhancing programme impact. Our new UNFPA Knowledge Management Strategy, which we shared with staff last week, aims to improve and effectively use the broad range of knowledge available at UNFPA, from the explicit knowledge found in documentation to the implicit knowledge stemming from staff experience and skills. We are deeply committed to making UNFPA a learning organization.  Innovation and data Mr. President, The world has made much progress in advancing rights and choices over the past 25 years; however, we know that too many women and girls continue to be left behind. UNFPA has set bold objectives to achieve by 2030 in order to change current trends. Yet, ending unmet demand for family planning, ending preventable maternal mortality, and ending gender-based violence and harmful practices will require a radical step change. It also requires ending the invisibility of the most vulnerable. We speak of the poorest women and girls, those who may live with disabilities and others facing stigma and discrimination. Their vulnerability is often magnified by their invisibility in data systems. This is why our work on population data is so important. UNFPA continues to prioritize innovation to create and scale-up data-driven, sustainable, open solutions to bring about transformative change for women, adolescents and youth. We have made a lot of progress, in no small part thanks to the Governments of Denmark and Finland, key supporters of UNFPAs Innovation Fund. One initiative made possible by this support is our Population Data Platform, which we presented to you last week. This will allow planners to identify and map where needs are greatest and where interventions need to focus to reach those furthest behind. By allowing us to combine different sources of data, such as census and surveys, the Population Data Platform can help highlight, for example, which districts in a country have the highest rates of child marriage, or where demand for contraceptives outstrips supply. More than 95 SDG indicators demand population data for their measurement. So while the platform is designed to advance UNFPAs work with governments in key areas of our mandate, we believe it offers value for shared UN system work and planning in countries, including as a contribution to the Common Country Assessments. UNFPA is also co-leading, together with WHO, work on data and digital health  one of the cross-cutting accelerators under the Global Action Plan for SDG3. This includes how to invest in technological advances in collecting, storing, processing and using data to make informed decisions and monitor progress so that no one is left behind.  Funding and strategic partnerships Mr. President, As a voluntarily funded organization, UNFPA continues to be vulnerable to external developments and global financial and political trends. Strategic partnerships bring resources, brainpower and visibility that are helping position UNFPA as a leader on our three transformative results. Last year we signed nearly 60 new partnerships, including with the private sector, bringing our total partnerships to 184. To cite just one example, our Eastern Europe and Central Asia Regional Office celebrated a strategic partnership with the Special Olympics to collaborate on reproductive health for young people with intellectual disabilities. Moreover, our collaborations with parliamentarians and civil society organizations continue to create a conducive environment for accelerating action. Their role has been critical to the concrete achievements that we have made together since Cairo 25 years ago. And their commitment remains strong. We saw at the International Parliamentarians Conference on the Implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action, held in Ottawa in October. We also rolled out an Individual Giving Strategy and implemented successful campaigns for Bangladesh and Yemen in 2018, and we will build on these promising results during the coming year. We recognize that every contribution to UNFPA is an expression of support for the ICPD Programme of Action and for UNFPAs mandate and work. I am therefore delighted that overall in 2018 UNFPA received support significantly above our funding targets for both core and non-core resources. We have not yet quite closed the books for 2018, but we expect that last years revenue will mark an all-time high. Yet, while we are grateful for the increased volume of support, we are concerned that the number of governments giving support has declined. We appeal to more governments to support UNFPA during this special year. With your help I hope that by the end of 2019 we can firmly say that UNFPA is stronger than ever  and that the ICPD has garnered more champions than ever! I am very happy to note that several key donors significantly increased support for core funding in 2018, which is foundational to our work. I wish to thank, in particular, the Governments of Sweden, Norway, New Zealand, Ireland, Italy, Japan, and China. Through the Strategic Funding dialogue, real strides have also been made towards multi-year core funding. Sweden and Egypt continue as champions, and a number of countries have committed to this mission-critical, strategic multi-year funding, including Belgium, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. We also expect non-core support in 2018 to be significantly above our target. We hope that support for our three thematic funds: UNFPA Supplies; the Maternal Health Thematic Fund; and new the Humanitarian Action Thematic Fund, will increase further in 2019. UNFPA's flagship Supplies programme reached record annual funding of around $170 million with the support of 16 donors. While time does not allow me mention all 16, the global leadership on family planning of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands has been critical in this effort, and we thank all 16 donors. On maternal health, sustained leadership by Sweden, Germany and Luxembourg has played a vital role. Let me also take this opportunity to welcome the increasing participation of programme country governments in funding projects and programmes, including in Latin America. Domestic resources will become an increasingly strategic component of funding and financing in middle-income countries.  Humanitarian Action As you know, 2018 was another challenging year for millions of women and girls whose lives have been upended by conflict, hazards, pandemics and displacement. UNFPA and its partners reached an estimated 18 million people in over 55 countries with humanitarian assistance. This included the implementation and coordination of the Minimum Initial Service Package for reproductive health to ensure that women and girls affected by humanitarian crisis have their needs addressed in line with humanitarian and human rights principles and priorities. We expect comparable challenges this year, with nearly 132 million in need of humanitarian assistance and protection globally. UNFPA aims to reach about 35 million women, girls and young people with life-saving sexual and reproductive health services, supplies and information, as well as interventions to prevent gender-based violence and to respond to the needs of survivors. We continue to push to ensure that the health, rights and needs of women and girls are at the forefront of humanitarian action. Tomorrow morning, we will officially launch our humanitarian appeal for 2019. UNFPA continues to strengthen our ability to respond quickly in emergencies. We have scaled up our roving team and augmented our surge mechanism, while strengthening support for staff serving in high-risk duty stations. Surge deployments increased by 50 percent over the past two years and our turnaround time was up 33 percent. They say that teamwork makes the dream work, and UNFPAs global staff is truly a dream team. I salute, in particular, our colleagues serving on the frontlines of our humanitarian work, who deliver day in and day out in some of the most difficult and dangerous settings. While financial resources are crucial to our work, they would be useless without our people, who remain the most valuable asset of UNFPA. On that note, I am pleased to welcome Josephine Mbithi as the new Director of Human Resources. Josephine brings to UNFPA a long, distinguished track record of international human resources experience in both the private and public sector, and we look forward to her contributions to enhancing UNFPAs incredibly dedicated workforce in more than 150 countries around the world. In closing, Mr. President, I had the good fortune to be in Cairo nearly 25 years ago. I remember the excitement, the sense of purpose and of being witness to something truly extraordinary  countries from all regions of the world committing to enabling people to make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health as a matter of fundamental human rights and as a foundation for individual and collective well-being. The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development is remarkable. It promoted a vision of integrated development that foreshadowed Agenda 2030 of the current day. It emphasized principles that underpin todays Sustainable Development Goals  non-discrimination and universality; the centrality of health, education and womens empowerment to sustainable development; and the collective need to ensure environmental sustainability. But its first principle is people. At its core, ICPD is about recognizing that peoples rights, their choices, and their well-being are the path to sustainable development. Twenty-five years of evidence and practice continue to support this consensus. As I speak, somewhere in the world, a young woman is in labour. Anywhere in the world, we wonder, will she face complications? If so, will they endanger her life, and that of the child she carries? Will she have access to a doctor or midwife? Will they have the training and skills to help her deliver safely? If she survives, will she get to hear the first cry of her newborn? If she does survive, will she have access to the services and information she needs to decide whether or when to have any future children? If the health system works, the answer will be yes. If her reproductive rights are respected and upheld, the answer will be yes. We want this for every woman and girl, everywhere. Access to quality respectful information and health services. The ability to exercise her right to decide freely whether, when, with whom to have children. Freedom from violence and harmful practices. Lets make these rights and choices a reality for all. Together, we can do this. If we persist and persevere, I am optimistic that, of course, we shall prevail. Theres no turning back! I hope you will join us. Lets keep moving forward."
NA,"press","29 March 2021","Speech  The power to say yes, the right to say no, 29 March 2021   Guest lecture at the London School of Economics Hosted by the LSE Global Health Initiative       Thank you, Dr Rishita, for your kind introduction, and my thanks to the London School of Economics Global Health Initiative. It is a pleasure to be here with all of you. Somewhere today at this moment an adolescent girl is waking up. Shell discover she is expected to undergo a rite of passage, forever to be wounded by female genital mutilation (FGM). another girl is being told to get dressed because today will be her wedding day. Shes scarcely 13 years of age. and a woman has been walking for a couple of hours, headed to her village health centre to seek contraception. When she arrives shell be sternly informed that there will be no prescription without her husbands consent. Allow me then, to get straight to the heart of the matter: Who is the owner of a girls body? Is a womans body her own? Is it her right to say yes or say no? Ive just returned from a humanitarian mission to Yemen, where I spoke to young girls and pregnant women who had to flee for their lives and seek protection at a UNFPA-supported shelter. They told harrowing stories of over six years of grinding conflict, now made worse by Covid-19 and a looming famine. Families are desperate, and many are marrying off their daughters very young. I met Alea. At 13, she was given to a 30-year-old man. When I told my father I didnt want to get married, she told me, he said by getting married I would have a better life. But my life only got worse. She complained when her husband sold off her wedding jewelry. In response, he beat her. When she ran back to her fathers house for protection, he beat her too and chased her back to her husband. I had nowhere left to go, she said. Fortunately, a kind neighbour phoned the UNFPA supported hotline and helped Alea escape. Now Alea lives at the locally run UNFPA shelter, where she attends training workshops and receives psychosocial support to help her recovery. She dreams of returning to school one day. Her story is not unique. Its one I heard repeatedly from girls in Yemen, and time and again in many countries around the world. In essence, the abrupt disruption of the lives of women and girls whose bodies have not been respected as belonging to them. A recent UNFPA study in 57 developing countries found that nearly half of women lack the power to make their own decisions ...About whether to have sexual relations with their partner. ...About the use of contraception. ...Or when to see a doctor or nurse. Often these very intimate decisions about their own bodies are taken out of womens hands by another  their male partner, their family, their societies  even their governments. Fundamentally, bodily autonomy is about power and agency; its about choice. Above all, its about human dignity. Intertwined is the right to bodily integrity  the ability to live free from physical acts to which one does not consent. Its gratifying to see the significant gains in advancing such rights in recent decades. Today, more women than ever have access to modern contraception. More girls attend school. More communities are abandoning child marriage, female genital mutilation and other harmful practices. I applaud the increasing activism to stand up to end sexual harassment and abuse  from the global Hands Off and MeToo movements to important local campaigns like Dont Look Away in Sri Lanka, aimed at calling out harassment on buses and public transport. These growing movements show us that change is possible, that UNFPAs goal of an end to gender-based violence by 2030 and the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterress call to Member States for peace in the home are within reach. Still, for too many, especially women and girls, life is fraught with violations of their bodily autonomy and integrity. We see the desperation when a lack of contraceptive choice leads to unintended pregnancy. We see it in the unspeakable, intolerable bargain to exchange unwanted sex for a home, food or aid. We see it in life-derailing practices such as child marriage. Autonomy is violated when someone of a diverse sexual orientation or gender identity cannot walk down a street without fear of assault or humiliation. When someone with a disability is stripped of their right to self-determination, to be free from violence, to enjoy a safe and satisfying sexual life. Some violations, such as rape, may be criminalized but not always prosecuted. Others go unchallenged, reinforced by community norms, practices and laws. Marital rape remains legal in 34 countries. And in some places, a rapist escapes penalty by marrying his victim. During war and conflict womens bodies literally become a battleground. Rape and sexual slavery are horrifically being used as tactics of war. And if youre paying attention you know that femicide, deaths of women too often at the hands of a domestic partner, is rampant  as is impunity for the perpetrators. Now COVID-19 is setting women back even further. Sexual and gender-based violence has skyrocketed around the world. Child marriage, female genital mutilation and adolescent pregnancy, once receding, are again on the rise. UNFPA projects that progress towards ending gender-based violence and female genital mutilation could be reduced by one third due to the pandemic. The far-reaching economic consequences of the pandemic have disrupted programmes to end child marriage by 2030. This could result in an additional 13 million child marriages that otherwise would not have occurred. Overstretched health systems find it too easy to scale back sexual and reproductive health services, often deemed less essential. At times, Covid-related movement restrictions and fear of infection keep women from seeking care they need. UNFPA estimates almost 12 million women lost access to family planning services since the pandemic began, already resulting in almost one and a half (1.4) million unintended pregnancies. Analysis of six countries in Latin America and the Caribbean shows it is adolescent girls who face the greatest barriers in accessing services, leading to projections of half a million additional teen pregnancies over the course of the pandemic. Within Africa, Kenya and other countries already have seen spikes in teenage pregnancy. School closures and movement restrictions leave girls more vulnerable to sexual coercion and violence. As children stay home and family members fall ill, it is women who bear the burden of care. Economists report women increasingly dropping out, rolling back decades of hard-won progress in womens labour force participation. Even before the pandemic, every single day women and girls were logging some 12 billion hours of unpaid care work around the world  three times more than men. None of it accounted for in GDP. When women have an income, abundant evidence shows they, more likely than men, will invest in their families and communities, thereby strengthening economies and making them more resilient. Supportive policies that enhance womens opportunities and empowerment make sense, to the benefit of everyone. The realization of bodily autonomy is at the heart of sexual and reproductive health and rights and all we do at UNFPA: its our purpose. Its also the topic of our flagship State of World Population report this year, which well release on April 14. Bodily autonomy is a pre-condition for reaching UNFPAs three ambitious aims  our three zeros  by the year 2030: zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths, and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices. All based on quality census and survey data to ensure that no one is left out or left behind. These three zeros, again as regards: contraception, mother and newborn survival, and an end to sexual and gender based violence  underpin the whole of gender equality and they bear on world success in achieving all of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. As the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPAs programmes are guided by the Programme of Action of the ICPD, the International Conference on Population and Development, which was adopted by member states in Cairo in 1994. It made empowerment and autonomy of women a basis for global action towards sustainable economic and social progress. As the worlds largest provider of donated contraceptives in low- and middle-income countries, UNFPA works to strengthen health systems and to dismantle barriers to services. Im proud that we are leading advocates for youth-friendly services, because for young people who do wish to act responsibly, information about sexuality and reproductive health is empowering. The nurses and midwives UNFPA trains and deploys, in my opinion, are heroes, true angels on Earth. They willingly cross rivers and move mountains, to make life-saving reproductive health services more accessible and affordable to women, even in the most remote and underserved areas. Working jointly with UNICEF and with civil society groups and the private sector, we are helping end practices like child marriage and female genital mutilation to uphold girls autonomy and protect them from violations of their bodily integrity. Part of the solution is girls confidently knowing they have rights from an early age. UNFPA advocates for girls to complete their schooling, including comprehensive sexuality education. Girls and boys, too, must know about healthy relationships and consent, and must be equipped with the vital knowledge to protect themselves from unintended pregnancy, all too commonplace violence, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. And during times of crisis, UNFPA leads coordination of the humanitarian communitys gender based violence prevention and response efforts. We are passionate and relentless in our advocacy for greater progress because, despite gains in advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights and bodily autonomy in recent decades, the pace of change is not fast enough. We simply cant afford to wait another 25 or 50 years! At the recent Nairobi Summit commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Cairo ICPD, leaders from around the world  from presidents to the grassroots, youth activists to private sector CEOs  pledged to pick up the pace. They envisioned a world where every pregnancy is intentional because every woman has voluntary access to the contraceptive she wants, and where no woman dies giving life. They foresaw an end to violence and practices that harm women and girls. And they made more than 1250 concrete commitments to turn that vision into reality. The march from Cairo to Nairobi continues onward. The movement for universal sexual and reproductive health and rights and bodily autonomy gains further momentum this year, as the Generation Equality Forum in Mexico and France accelerates progress since the historic Beijing Womens Conference in 1995. Gender inequality is a most insidious and pervasive impediment to bodily autonomy. Gender-unequal norms and attitudes buttress the power imbalance that constrains womens autonomy. Those norms and attitudes drive the expectation that women will defer to their husbands or partners, in all aspects of their lives. We see these harmful norms and attitudes reverberating in the increasing political pushback against womens rights. The personal is political. Issues even tangentially related to gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights do not have universal buy-in, shall I say, and are perpetually subject to intense negotiations in multilateral spaces. We see growing polarization, rising populist nationalism  and the space for civil society participation, including womens rights groups, ever shrinking. More and more we witness regressive forces coming together to counter progress for women and girls, whose health and rights are being traded in a game of geopolitical football. Yet, despite the strong headwinds in many places, there is a stronger movement pushing forward  of governments, civil society and grassroots activists, business and community leaders, and faith-based organizations. The energy and commitments coming out of the Nairobi Summit speak to it. And we see it in the follow-up actions to make commitments to women and girls real where it matters most, in countries, on the ground. The UN Secretary-General has called for a renewed and inclusive multilateralism to meet the complex global challenges we face. There is optimism. When women and girls are able to make the most fundamental choices about their bodies, they gain in terms of autonomy, yes, but society gains also, through advances in health and education, income and safety. These add up to a world of greater justice and human well-being, which benefits us all. So how can we ensure that everyone is able to exercise these fundamental rights and choices? First, uproot the harmful attitudes and gender norms that hold women and girls back. This requires slow, steady work in community after community. But it is possible  and it is happening. London writer Justina Kehinde laid down the challenge in her poem for the International Day for the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation this year. Quoting her: Not everything we inherit is a gift to be passed on. We gain more than we lose when we choose to move on."" Another thing: Women and girls must claim their rights. States must uphold these rights. And men must be willing to step forward and step away from dominating roles that privilege their power and their choices over womens. Adolescent boys will need far more positive notions of what constitutes manhood during a time of life when harmful gender norms start to crystallize. As the writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie puts it: Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage. I believe its long past time to free boys from it. Comprehensive sexuality education for boys, age appropriate, instills the values of respect, equality, and consent. In UNFPA clubs in Zambia, adolescent girls and boys can safely express their fears and aspirations, and learn how to better relate to one another. In Niger and across West Africa, UNFPA runs very popular community husbands schools that constructively engage men and boys, and cultural and religious leaders, in support of family planning and womens participation. In Georgia, UNFPA supports a programme called MenCare, which promotes mens involvement as loving fathers and equitable household caregivers. In the Sahel region of West Africa, UNFPA and the World Bank partner with local communities to support womens economic empowerment. The countries involved reap a demographic dividend through a package of interventions to keep girls in school while delaying marriage and childbearing. Research tells us that for every $4.60 invested in an adolescent girls physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health, the return is at least 10 times as much, in benefits to society. Lastly, action is needed to tackle laws and policies that reinforce discriminatory norms. In the Republic of Korea, for example, reforms in labour laws were a key driver in shifting old norms about son preference, the value of girls, and age of marriage. Most economies are structured to concentrate resources and decision-making in a few privileged hands of Adam, hands that mostly belong to men. The #MeToo movement, and surveys, show us just how bad it is for women in terms of choice and autonomy, when it comes to their power to say no. Ending impunity for sexual violence and harassment in all forms is essential, and overdue. Womens empowerment and autonomy require substantial and sustained investment. National gender equality action plans and institutions remain chronically underfunded. True also for womens groups on the front lines of providing vital protection services that assist survivors of gender-based violence. UNFPA, Johns Hopkins University and other academic partners estimate that it will take investments of around 264 billion US dollars (or just over $26 billion a year) to achieve the three zeros  to end the unmet need for family planning, stop preventable maternal deaths, and end gender-based violence by 2030. Of this $264 billion sum, only $42 billion is currently projected to be provided by donors. Thats in the form of usual development assistance over the course of the next decade. This means that the remainder, the new investment of $222 billion, would need to come from a combination of shifts of domestic government spending, additional international development assistance, the private sector, civil society and philanthropy. These resources likely will be even harder to come by as countries grapple with the economic fallout of COVID-19. The impact of the pandemic on aid budgets and other types of development assistance is not yet clear, but there are worrying signs. According to the OECD Global Outlook on Financing for Sustainable Development 2021, private financing has already collapsed  falling $700 billion in 2020. While ODA specifically to the sexual and reproductive health sector saw gradual increases over the years, it peaked in 2017 at a little over 11 billion USD, and by 2019 support had fallen back to just under US$8 billion. The United Kingdom, in recent years UNFPAs largest and most steadfast bilateral donor, just announced cuts to its global aid budget. While thankfully the UK remains a strong political supporter of UNFPA and our sexual and reproductive health and rights mandate more broadly, the budget cuts will be felt keenly by UNFPA and reverberate throughout the sector. This economic and financial uncertainty is why we strive to get the partnerships piece of the equation right. For UNFPA, we build on our relationships with governments, international financial institutions, with communities and the private sector to help countries unlock and implement the financing thats so needed by vulnerable women and girls. Data is also key. It is said that only what gets measured gets done. If so, there is cause for concern when it comes to bodily autonomy. Just 13 per cent of countries have a dedicated budget to collect and analyze gender statistics, an information gap, an information abyss really, that makes it difficult to develop services and policies to effectively support gender equality and autonomy. Issues like gender-based violence and unpaid care work remain invisible, under the radar, uncounted and unaddressed. Gender-disaggregated data for adolescents, and for socially excluded girls, are particularly scarce. Data invisibility also affects LGBTI people of sexual diversities, people with disabilities, and anyone who is discriminated against or denied autonomy because of their race, ethnicity or economic status. We can do better. Governments, social and economic institutions, communities, families and men can all do better. I will challenge you, to please challenge discrimination wherever and whenever you encounter it. Dont be complacent about it and dont be complicit. It also means keeping up pressure on governments to act, and holding leaders accountable for making good on commitments to gender equality, to official development assistance and domestic spending. Im so happy about the presence of so many young people here today. Use your power. You are more connected than any generation before you, and your voice and channels raise awareness, challenge harmful attitudes, norms and practices, and youre vociferous in your demands for inclusion, equality and change. Your commitment to social responsibility and ethics, to climate action, to making societies and the world a better place, inspires me and reassures me that we will succeed in living our values. Transforming the balance of power and upholding individual human rights. Thats fundamental to our common humanity  and as a matter of practice, also essential if we are to conquer todays biggest challenges  from poverty and inequality to sexism, racism and the climate crisis. Whereas these challenges historically are the result of decisions taken primarily by certain men, always they have had a disproportionate impact upon women and girls. Therefore, women and girls know what works  and they must be fully part of the solution. The power to say yes, the right to say no. My purpose today was to convince you to help stop the annihilation of the spirit that lack of bodily autonomy represents for women and girls. I pray Ive succeeded. Working hard for full equality for all of us in all our beautiful diversities, the United Nations stands with you, walking the path to peace, towards a safer and more just world. A world where all peoples live in dignity, where a girl wakes up knowing that she alone owns her body, that her society will protect her, that as she says Yes to the future that beckons, its a future that is hers to determine. Adelante!"
NA,"press","25 June 2014","Speech  Statement by the Executive Director to the Executive Board 25 June 2014   UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin's remarks at the Annual Session of the UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS Executive Board 2014 Remarks as prepared for delivery Mr. President,Distinguished Members of the Executive Board,Colleagues and friends,Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be here with you again in the beautiful city of Geneva. Let me start by thanking you for your continued support and feedback, which is essential to ensuring many of the results that I will speak to you about today and which facilitates our efforts to create an organization fit for purpose and ready to address current and future challenges efficiently and effectively. We remain committed to results and improving our accountability to our Member States, and most importantly, to those we serve. As you know, this is a crucial year. Member States, supported by UNFPA, are concluding the ICPD@20 review process, which will culminate with the Special Session of the UN General Assembly in September. They are also working together to define future Sustainable Development Goals, which we hope will reflect many of the lessons learned and recommendations from the global ICPD beyond 2014 review. The findings of the ICPD review, which we shared with the Board earlier this year, revealed tremendous progress over the two decades since Cairo, progress that points to the criticality of the Programme of Action to broader efforts to achieve sustainable development. Maternal mortality has fallen by nearly 50 percent. Womens access to family planning and antenatal care has also improved. More women have access to education, work and political participation. More girls are going to school. But we still have a long way to go. The belief in, commitment to and support for human rights, gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are far from universal. Each days news brings home this reality in vivid detail. Another girl hanging from a tree, another woman dead from an utterly honourless killing, another adolescent life lost to an unsafe abortion or to AIDS, another school empty. One out of every three women in the world, in every country and from every background, will experience physical or sexual violence in her lifetime. They are not safe at school, not safe fetching water, not safe on a university campus, not even on the steps of a courthouse or in their own homes. Discrimination and harmful traditions such as child marriage and female genital mutilation/cutting persist, and the perpetrators operate with impunity, even in the face of laws against such practices. Is there a tipping point? When will we finally say enough to violence and discrimination against women and girls? When will we finally bring back our girls  all our girls and women  to their schools, to the workforce, to their rightful place alongside men and boys at the table where decisions are made, and away from child marriage, away from early pregnancy, away from HIV infection, away from violence and harmful practices that strip them of their dignity and in the worst cases deprive them of their lives? Only then will we be able to build the future we all want. Women continue to die giving life  at least one somewhere in the world since I began speaking and another 20 more before Im through  many of them adolescent girls. Right now as I speak to you, a girl, perhaps no more than 10 years old, poor, most likely living in a remote rural area, is being forced to leave the only home she has ever known. She is frightened, confused and above all powerless to stop the transaction taking place  her marriage to a much older man. Today is the day that her childhood ends, and along with it, her education, her aspirations and any chance of reaching her full potential  a brutal violation of her human rights. Every two seconds a girl under the age of 18 is married. Yet despite these statistics, discriminatory laws, practices and attitudes continue to keep women and young people, particularly adolescent girls, from accessing sexual and reproductive health services, including contraception, and realizing their reproductive rights. More than 200 million women in low and middle income countries today do not have access to modern contraception. Tens of millions of our young people do not have access to good quality comprehensive sexuality education. And the consequences in loss of health, empowerment, education and opportunities for work are profound  for individuals, but also for their communities and societies. This is our great unfinished business. As we mark the 20th anniversary of the ICPD and work together to forge a sustainable development agenda for the future, it is crucial that we address the persistent discrimination and inequalities hitting the poorest and most marginalized among us. And it is vital that we uphold the rights of women, girls and all young people  for their own dignity and well-being, but also because doing so is the key to meeting any future development goals. Resilient societies are built by resilient individuals, and building individual resilience requires meeting individuals needs but also protecting and advancing their human rights. As head of UNFPA, its clear to me that human rights mean different things to different countries. So if we are going to make progress, we must work towards a common understanding of the universality of human rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UN has a critical role to play in making this happen.Human rights are not a luxury to be enjoyed only after development has occurred. They are the very foundation of development. There can be no development without human rights. Our predecessors in Cairo understood that, and we all must continue to drive home that message in the coming months and during the UN General Assembly Special Session on ICPD beyond 2014, and ensure that it is the cornerstone of the next development agenda. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me turn now to the annual report of the Executive Director for 2013 (DP/FPA/2014/5), which focuses on the progress achieved on the reforms that UNFPA adopted following the midterm review of the strategic plan, 2008-2013. The reforms aimed to make UNFPA more responsive to the changing global development environment and to improve the positioning and implementation of the ICPD agenda. As the report shows, UNFPA has made progress in improving both its strategic focus on sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and its programmatic and operational effectiveness and efficiency. You will recall that upon my assumption of office, I developed a Business Plan to support and accelerate the implementation of the outcome of the midterm review of UNFPA's Strategic Plan. The seven-point plan was aimed at refocusing the organization's efforts on the bull's eye, making country programmes a top priority, investing in strategic communications to ensure that we speak with One Voice, addressing human resource challenges, strengthening management and operations, breaking down silos, addressing performance issues and holding senior management accountable. Today, I am happy to report that we have done incredibly well in moving this agenda forward, even though work remains to be done in certain areas to consolidate our efforts. We have credible evidence to support improved staff performance, for instance, which is also closely linked with the fact that staff are working in concert rather than in silos. Let me share with you now some of the programmatic and operational results achieved in 2013. Maternal Health In the area of maternal health, UNFPA focused on accelerating progress towards achievement of the MDG5 targets. The Fund supported 38 countries efforts to strengthen emergency obstetric care and 43 countries efforts to strengthen midwifery so that more women survive childbirth and deliver healthy babies. Since the launch of UNFPAs Maternal Health Thematic Fund five years ago, training has been provided to more than 10,000 midwives, who assist 1.75 million births annually. Over 10,000 fistula repair surgeries were performed with UNFPA support in 2013, nearly a 30 per cent increase over 2012. Family Planning 2013 saw the roll-out of UNFPAs new family planning strategy, Choices not chance, which will guide our efforts to increase access to voluntary family planning information, services and supplies, so that individuals and couples can decide whether to have children, and if they choose to do so, when and how many. UNFPA committed 40 per cent of its programme resources to family planning in 2013, which enabled us to help 95 countries improve the availability and choice of contraceptives. The newly established Steering Committee for the Global Programme to Enhance Reproductive Health Commodity Security, chaired by me and comprising key donors and partners, is ensuring oversight and guidance of financial and technical support to countries through the GPRHCS, which has mobilized about $565 million since 2007. Promotion of increased domestic funding resulted in a number of countries increasing their family planning budgets, including the Philippines, which became self-sufficient, procuring enough modern contraceptives to ensure a constant supply. The country also passed a landmark reproductive health law that expands access to information and services, including family planning and sexuality education. Several African countries also increased their financial commitments, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. With UNFPA support, a number of countries have seen significant increases in their contraceptive prevalence rates in recent years, including Burundi, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Madagascar and Niger, among others. For example, in Burundi, CPR rose from just 1.2 per cent in 1987 to nearly 18 per cent in 2011, and was estimated at 27 per cent in 2013. Another example is Liberia where CPR rose from 10.3 per cent in 2003 to an estimated 19.1 per cent in 2013. I can mention many other countries that have made similar progress. UNFPA remains actively engaged in the FP2020 platform, and we continue to strengthen our partnerships. In 2013, for example, UNFPA and the International Planned Parenthood Federation launched an effort to increase access to family planning by youth, including vulnerable adolescents, in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, UNFPA remained the largest supplier of female condoms, providing 20 million. We also supplied an unprecedented 1 billion male condoms. The CONDOMIZE! Campaign continues to raise awareness among youth of condoms triple protection against HIV, STIs and unintended pregnancies. Integrated Service Delivery UNFPA continues to provide leadership and document good practices in bringing together action that jointly and positively affects sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention and treatment outcomes. Integrated HIV and sexual and reproductive health services, including in antenatal care to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, are reported in about 70 percent of countries. Universal access means leaving no one behind. UNFPA worked in partnership with the World Health Organization, the Network of Sex Work Projects, the World Bank, and the UNAIDS secretariat to create a tool for implementing comprehensive HIV and sexually transmitted infection programmes with sex workers. Tools focused on key populations under development this year will help us move towards the end of AIDS. Adolescents and Youth We continued to strengthen our focus on young people, with development of an adolescent and youth strategy and a separate youth focus in the strategic plan. In 2013, 71 percent of country programmes formulated that year included a separate output on youth, as compared to 7 percent of those formulated in 2011. While continuing to advocate for youth issues in international fora, UNFPA supported platforms for youth participation in 82 countries. Young people were actively engaged in the regional conferences to review progress in implementing the ICPD Programme of Action, making their voices heard on a range of issues affecting them, their countries and the planet. 102 countries received support to design and implement comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education programmes for young people. In East and Southern Africa, UNFPA teamed up with UNESCO, UNAIDS and other partners to support governments efforts to expand access to comprehensive sexuality education and develop curricula. The UNFPA-supported Y-PEER youth network reached more than 1.5 million young people in the Arab States in 2013 with theatre-based programmes that provide information about sexual and reproductive health. Y-PEER also helped raise awareness among refugees and displaced persons in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Sudan and Syria. Gender Equality I mentioned earlier that there can be no development without human rights. And now Id like to be more specific: There can be no development without womens rights. In 2013, we supported 123 countries in adopting international agreements and national laws and policies advancing gender equality and strengthened capacity in 86 countries for elimination of gender-based violence, including female genital mutilation. In 2013, over 4,000 communities declared abandonment of female genital mutilation/cutting compared to 1677 in 2011. UNFPA and UNICEF continued our joint work in 15 countries to accelerate the abandonment of FGM/C, and the recent evaluation of this programme shows it is making an impact in increasing momentum for change. The next phase of the programme will focus greater attention on other harmful practices that result from adverse gender norms, particularly child marriage. We have found that programmes that work with communities, but also invest directly in girls, are not only successful in delaying the age of marriage and reducing FGM/C, but also improve other indicators. That is why UNFPA is scaling up our programmatic focus on adolescent girls. Our Action for Adolescent Girls initiative is supporting national governments and local partners in 12 countries with targeted investments aimed at reaching the most marginalized girls in the poorest communities. In Niger, which has the highest rates of child marriage in the world, out-of school girls between the ages of 10 and 19 in 40 communities are participating in an 8-month programme that includes a health check-up, literacy training, and a birth certificate or national identity card. Other activities include community dialogue sessions, and national level advocacy against child marriage. UNFPA is also partnering with the World Bank to enable Niger and other countries in the Sahel to reap the demographic dividend through a package of interventions aimed at keeping girls in school and delaying marriage and childbearing. The Bank has committed $100 million to UNFPA as part of this initiative, which includes investments in education and skills development, sexual and reproductive health information and services, including contraception, and engaging local communities, particularly boys and men, in changing harmful social norms that hold girls and women back. Id like to add that we are enhancing our internal capacity to work more proactively with the Bank and capitalize on synergies. UNFPA also supported civil society organizations in 19 countries in West and Central Africa that engage men and boys in efforts to promote gender equality, eliminate discriminatory gender norms and protect womens reproductive rights. Population Policies and Data Efforts to build countries capacity for generating population data and using the information to guide policymaking continued in 2013. With UNFPA support, over 100 countries strengthened their capacity in production, analysis and dissemination of census data and 92 countries in integrating population dynamics in national development strategies and policies. Humanitarian response By the end of 2013, UNFPA and the international community were responding to three large-scale disasters concurrently, and though the challenges were and still remain significant, UNFPA succeeded in improving its response mechanisms to ensure more effective humanitarian action in affected countries. In 2012, UNFPA implemented 70 life-saving programmes in 39 countries, and in 2013, implementation increased by over 50 per cent through 105 programmes globally. Capacity building activities laid the foundation for these programmes: nearly 9,500 service providers from over 37 conflict or disaster prone countries were trained on the set of priority interventions to be implemented at the onset of a disaster - the Minimum Initial Service Package for reproductive health in emergencies. In 2013, the Gender-based Violence Information Management System (GBVIMS) Global Team supported GBV service providers in 27 countries. Internally, in 2013, over 150 UNFPA country and regional staff were trained on the foundations of humanitarian programming and four regional offices now have full time Humanitarian Coordinators and two regional offices have humanitarian focal points. The Second Generation humanitarian strategy was approved in 2012, and the Fund is fully committed to continuing to improve its humanitarian response capacity, based on the experience from Syria, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, the Philippines and now Iraq. Furthermore, the strategy and the new strategic plan prioritize mainstreaming humanitarian preparedness and response. A surge roster of 44 staff was established in 2012 and supported deployments to all level three emergencies as well as to other countries responding to disasters, for example in the Sahel. Internally, funding to support the scale-up and expansion of UNFPA's humanitarian action has been increased: fragility and risk for humanitarian crisis have been factored into the new Resource Allocation System and the HQ Emergency Fund has been increased from $3 to 5 million. From external sources, 31 countries and territories benefitted from co-financing contributions of approximately $40.2 million, which is a 48 percent increase over 2012. In 2014 we will continue to integrate preparedness and disaster risk reduction in our development results framework to ensure a more predictable, effective and measurable response and to achieve sustainable resilience in high risk countries. Results-based management UNFPA continued to strengthen programme and results planning and monitoring and improved the quality of our country programme documents. The Strategic Plan 2014-2017 that you approved in September 2013 has a much more robust and field-informed results framework compared to previous strategic plans. Compared to the period prior to the Midterm review in 2011, today UNFPA country programmes are more focused and tailored to local development priorities and needs as well as the ability to pay for those needs. Country programmes are aligned with the strategic plan and have stopped the practice of doing everything everywhere. And for all planned results, we specify indicators, with baselines and targets. Programme evaluation improved with the adoption of a revised UNFPA evaluation policy and the creation of an independent Evaluation Office. This reflects efforts over the past two years to strengthen evaluation capacity throughout the Fund. In this regard, I would like to call your attention to the Report of the Director of the Evaluation Office as well as the management response. Mr. President, Ladies and gentlemen, As you may recall, the Board approved, at the second regular session in 2013, the resources for financing the global and regional interventions, which were then called the global and regional programme. At the same time, it requested us to develop a strategic framework for the global and regional interventions, aligning the framework with the new strategic plan, 2014-2017, and to present it to the Board for approval at this annual session. We have done as requested. A draft of this strategic framework was presented to the Board in January this year, and we have since taken the comments received into consideration in the final draft. Your comments included a strong desire for us to capture the different aspects of the global and regional interventions, including those that had earlier been described in various documents, in one single document. The strategic framework we present to you today, contained in document (DP/FPA/2014/8), describes the purpose of and the holistic vision for the global and regional interventions; the process of developing and reviewing the associated action plans; the resource allocation mechanism utilized; the content of the planned interventions; and details on implementation, including monitoring, reporting and evaluation. We are also presenting an addendum (DP/FPA/2014/8/Add.1), which lays out two separate results and resources frameworks, one for global and one for regional interventions. The indicative total in resources for the period 2014-2017 is $110 million for global interventions and $165 million for regional interventions, for a grand total of $275 million. As you will see, this is now a revamped mechanism with a clearer strategic focus, stronger results chains and greater accountability. We look forward to your comments on the new strategic framework in the discussion that follows. Funding/Resource mobilization In 2013, total UNFPA revenue was $976.7 million, including $495.6 million in regular resources. Total revenue decreased by $11.6 million (or 1.2 per cent) in 2013, due to a decrease in other resource revenue. Regular resource contribution revenue increased by $22.5 million, or 5.1 per cent, from 2012 to 2013. Total expenses in 2013 amounted to $913.2 million, of which around 84 per cent was spent on programme activities. We thank Member States for their continued support, particularly their core contributions. Predictable regular resources are critical to enable UNFPA to implement its strategic plan and help countries implement the ICPD agenda. We continue to work to diversify our resource base and mobilize new donors. As part of the broader discussions on UN fitness-for-purpose and QCPR implementation, UNFPA has engaged in a series of discussions with Executive Board members and our partner UN agencies on funding of our respective strategic plans for 2014-2017. For UNFPA, the initial stage culminated in an informal session with Executive Board members in June, which confirmed our strong partnership and laid the foundation for the next steps, including formal Executive Board discussion and dialogue with Member States on improving predictability and flexibility of funding and expanding the donor base. Human resources While financial resources are crucial to our work, they would be useless without our most valuable asset, our people. In 2013, UNFPA developed a new human resources strategy to align human resources management with the UNFPA strategic plan, 2014-2017, and the associated business model. The Human Resources Strategy focus is on building a world class fit-for-purpose workforce, creating an enabling environment in the organization and fostering a culture of inspiring leadership at all levels of UNFPA. In the past year alone the Division for Human Resources has led country office change management programmes in more than 20 countries and has itself undergone a comprehensive transformation process resulting in a more logical, decentralized structure with the creation of HR Strategic Partners in all Regional Offices. We have also developed and implemented a leadership pool concept, which has helped to build UNFPA bench strength for critical leadership positions and will, over the coming years, lead to a much reduced vacancy rate for leadership positions and provided tailored learning for rotational staff in country offices. The Leadership Pool is also complimented by other initiatives including a leadership development programme, or LEAD, facilitated in conjunction with Cranfield University, the LEAP programme aimed at developing support staff and a sabbatical programme to help staff remain at the 'cutting edge' of their profession. We have focused on maintaining adequate staffing levels and on strengthening a culture of accountability by addressing under-performance. UNFPAs performance management system and, more importantly, performance culture is widely recognized within the UN system. All staff members have an important role to play in driving organizational results and in improving UNFPA performance, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank UNFPA staff for their valuable contributions to our work. Mr. President, Ladies and gentlemen, We have ample evidence, including from the ICPD beyond 2014 review, showing that development gains made in the two decades since Cairo have not improved the lives of all. Discrimination and inequalities persist, and perceptions of and commitment to human rights, particularly reproductive rights, and gender equality are not universal. But we are making progress. We at UNFPA are encouraged by the positive support we see and hear from many Member States who are eager to speed up delivery on the ICPD agenda, particularly related to universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning. Many Member States and civil society groups are advocating for renewed efforts to address future challenges in relation to population and development. This was seen in the feedback provided by Member States in the ICPD operational review, including the regional conference outcomes, and in many national statements made at the recent Commission on Population and Development and at the International Parliamentarians Conference on ICPD, held in Stockholm in April. When Member States adopted the forward-looking Cairo agenda 20 years ago, they understood that there was a compelling case for placing human rights  including sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights  at the heart of development. Only by ensuring individual dignity and wellbeing, including and especially among the poorest, most marginalized and excluded, can we achieve sustainable development. If we can ensure that the girl I mentioned earlier and others like her are able to enjoy their right to education and stay in school, are protected from violence, early marriage and other harmful practices, have access to the information and means to avoid unwanted pregnancy and HIV, are equipped with choices and opportunities, they, along with their brothers, will become powerful agents for social change and will shape a better future for all of us. We at UNFPA believe that a coherent, comprehensive focus on this generation of adolescents, particularly girls, is one of the best investments we can make and will ensure a more equitable, just and sustainable future. Too often in development discussions and policies, the links between the micro and macro levels are severed  between the individual, like our 10-year-old girl, on the one hand, and collective environmental sustainability, macroeconomic growth, and poverty eradication, on the other. But current efforts to define a new sustainable development agenda beyond 2015 offer a unique opportunity to repair these linkages and reaffirm the core message of Cairo  that collective sustainability rests on a foundation of individual dignity and rights. The first step is to ensure that gender equality, sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and the rights and needs of adolescents and youth, which will determine the worlds ability to achieve the post-2015 agenda and sustainable development, are as prominent and integrated as possible in the future Sustainable Development Goals. This is something that must be addressed by many stakeholders. But I would like to call on Member States as you define and refine the future Sustainable Development Goals, and as we meet in New York in September for both the UN General Assembly Special Session on ICPD beyond 2014 and the Climate Summit, to keep both the micro and macro perspectives in mind. Because the truth is, sustainable development is as much about our 10-year-old girl as it is about GDP or degrees Celsius. Thank you."
